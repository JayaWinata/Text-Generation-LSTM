      "Many tasks involving intelligence or pattern recognition \n",
      "are extremely difficult to automate, but appear to be  \n",
      "perfor med very easily by humans. For instance, human s \n",
      "recognize various objects and make sense out of the large \n",
      "amount of visual information in their surroundings, \n",
      "apparently requiring very little effort. It stands to reason \n",
      "that computing systems that attempt s imilar tasks will profit \n",
      "enormou sly from understanding how human s perform these \n",
      "tasks, and simulating these processes to the extent allowed \n",
      "by physical limitations. This necessitates the study and \n",
      "simulation of Neural Networks.  The neural network of an \n",
      "human is part of its nervous system, containing a large \n",
      "number of interconnected neurons (nerve cells). “Neural” is \n",
      "an adjective for neuron, and “Network” denotes a graph like \n",
      "structure. Artificial Neural Network refers to computing \n",
      "systems whose central them e is borrowed from the analogy \n",
      "of biological neural networks.  Artificial Neural Networks \n",
      "are also referred to as “Neural Nets”, artificial neural \n",
      "systems “parallel distributed processing systems” and \n",
      "“connectionist systems”. For a computing system to be \n",
      "called by these pretty names, it is necessary for the system \n",
      "to have a labeled directed graph structure where nodes \n",
      "perform some simple computations. From elementary graph \n",
      "theory we recall that a “Directed Graph” consists of a set of  \n",
      "“Nodes”  (vertices) and  a set of “Connections” \n",
      "(edges/links/arcs) connecting pairs of nodes. In a neural \n",
      "network, each node performs some simple computations, \n",
      "and each connection conveys a signal from one node to \n",
      "another, labeled by a number called the “Connection \n",

      "First, the synapses of the neuron are modeled as weights. \n",
      "The strength of the connection between an input and a \n",

      "It is reasonable to conjecture that neurons in an animal’s \n",
      "brain are “hard wired.” It is equally obvious that animals, \n",
      "especially the higher order animals, learn as they grow. \n",

      "summarize some of the basic theories of biological learning \n",
      "and their adaptations for artificial neural networks. In \n",
      "artificial neural networks, learning refers to the method of \n",
      "modifying the weights of c onnections between the nodes of \n",
      "a specified network.  Learning is the process by which the \n",
      "random -valued parameters (Weights and bias) of a neural \n",
      "network are adapted through a continuous process of \n",
      "simulation by the environment in which network is \n",
      "embedded . Learning rate is defined as the rate at which \n",
      "network gets adapted. Type of learning is determined by the \n",
      "manner in which parameter change takes place. Learning \n",
      "may be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised  \n",
      "learning and r einforced learning.  In Supervised learning,  a \n",
      "teacher is available to indicate whether a system is \n",
      "performing correctly, or to indicate a desired response, or to \n",
      "validate the acceptability of a system’s responses, or to \n",

      "available and learning must rely on guidance obtained \n",

      "or the environment. Learning is similar to training i.e. one \n",
      "has to learn somethi ng which is analogous to one has to be \n",
      "trained. A neural network has to be configured such that the \n",
      "application of a set of inputs produces (either 'direct' or via \n",
