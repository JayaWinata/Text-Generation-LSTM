      "ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n",
      "DR DAVID J SCHWARTZ was a world-renowned motivational speaker\n",
      "and personal development expert. Born in the United States in 1927, he\n",
      "went on to be a professor at Georgia State University, and later founded his\n",
      "own consultancy firm, Creative Educational Services Inc. CES Inc.\n",
      "specialised in leadership development and life strategy, subjects which\n",
      "Swchartz went on to write several highly-acclaimed books about. He passed\n",
      "away in 1987.\n",
      "For David III\n",
      "Our six-year-old son, David, felt mighty big when he was graduated from\n",
      "kindergarten. I asked him what he plans to be when he finishes growing up.\n",
      "Davey looked at me intently for a moment and then answered, “Dad, I want\n",
      "to be a professor.”\n",
      "“A professor? A professor of what?” I asked.\n",
      "“Well, Dad,” he replied, “I think I want to be a professor of happiness.”\n",
      "“A professor of happiness! That’s a pretty wonderful ambition, don’t you\n",
      "think?”\n",
      "To David, then, a fine boy with a grand goal, and to his mother, this book\n",
      "is dedicated.\n",
      "PREFACE\n",
      "Why this big book? Why a full-scale discussion of The Magic of Thinking\n",
      "Big? Thousands of books will be published this year. Why one more?\n",
      "Permit me to give you just a little background.\n",
      "Several years ago I witnessed an exceptionally impressive sales meeting.\n",
      "The vice president in charge of marketing for this company was\n",
      "tremendously excited. He wanted to drive home a point. He had with him\n",
      "on the platform the leading representative in the organization, a very\n",
      "ordinary-looking fellow, who earned in the year just ended just a little under\n",
      "$60,000. The earnings of other representatives averaged $12,000.\n",
      "The executive challenged the group. Here is what he said: “I want you to\n",
      "take a good look at Harry. Look at him! Now, what’s Harry got that the rest\n",
      "of you haven’t? Harry earned five times the average, but is Harry five times\n",
      "smarter? No, not according to our personnel tests. I checked. They show\n",
      "he’s about average in that department.\n",
      "“And did Harry work five times harder than you fellows? No-not\n",
      "according to the reports. In fact, he took more time off than most of you.\n",
      "“Did Harry have a better territory? Again I’ve got to say no. The\n",
      "accounts averaged about the same. Did Harry have more education? Better\n",
      "health? Again, no. Harry is about as average as an average guy could be\n",
      "except for one thing.\n",
      "“The difference between Harry and the rest of you,” said the vice\n",
      "president, “the difference is that Harry thought five times bigger.”\n",
      "Then the executive proceeded to show that success is determined not so\n",
      "much by the size of one’s brain as it is by the size of one’s thinking.\n",
      "This was an intriguing thought. And it stayed with me. The more I\n",
      "observed, the more people I talked with, the deeper I dug into what’s really\n",
      "behind success, the clearer was the answer. Case history after case history\n",
      "proved that the size of bank accounts, the size of happiness accounts, and\n",
      "the size of one’s general satisfaction account is dependent on the size of\n",
      "one’s thinking. There is magic in thinking big.\n",
      "“If ‘Thinking Big’ accomplishes so much, why doesn’t everyone think\n",
      "that way?” I’ve been asked that question many times. Here, I believe, is the\n",
      "answer. All of us, more than we recognize, are products of the thinking\n",
      "around us. And much of this thinking is little, not big. All around you is an\n",
      "environment that is trying to tug you, trying to pull you down Second Class\n",
      "Street. You are told almost daily that there are “too many chiefs and not\n",
      "enough Indians.” In other words, that opportunities to lead no longer exist,\n",
      "that there is a surplus of chiefs, so be content to be a little guy.\n",
      "But this “too many chiefs” idea simply doesn’t square with the truth.\n",
      "Leading people in all occupations will tell you, as they’ve told me, that “the\n",
      "trouble is, there are too many Indians and not nearly enough chiefs.”\n",
      "This pettily petty environment says other things too. It tells you,\n",
      "“Whatever will be will be,” that your destiny is outside your control, that\n",
      "“fate” is in complete control. So forget those dreams, forget that finer home,\n",
      "forget that special college for the children, forget the better life. Be\n",
      "resigned. Lie down and wait to die.\n",
      "And who hasn’t heard the statement that “Success isn’t worth the price,”\n",
      "as if you have to sell your soul, your family life, your conscience, your set\n",
      "of values to reach the top. But, in truth, success doesn’t demand a price.\n",
      "Every step forward pays a dividend.\n",
      "This environment also tells us there’s too much competition for the top\n",
      "spots in life. But is there? A personnel selection executive told me that he\n",
      "receives 50 to 250 times as many applicants for jobs that pay $10,000 per\n",
      "year as for jobs that pay $50,000 a year. This is to say that there is at least\n",
      "50 times as much competition for jobs on Second Class Street as for jobs on\n",
      "First Class Avenue. First Class Avenue, U.S.A., is a short, uncrowded\n",
      "street. There are countless vacancies waiting there for people like you who\n",
      "dare to think big.\n",
      "The basic principles and concepts supporting The Magic of Thinking Big\n",
      "come from the highest-pedigree sources, the very finest and biggest-\n",
      "thinking minds yet to live on planet Earth. Minds like the prophet David,\n",
      "who wrote, “As one thinketh in his heart, so is he”; minds such as Emerson,\n",
      "who said, “Great men are those who see that thoughts rule the world”;\n",
      "minds like Milton, who in Paradise Lost wrote, “The mind is its own place\n",
      "and in itself can make a heaven of hell or a hell of heaven.” Amazingly\n",
      "perceptive minds like Shakespeare, who observed, “There is nothing either\n",
      "good or bad except that thinking makes it so.”\n",
      "But where does the proof come from? How do we know the master\n",
      "thinkers were right? Fair questions. The proof comes from the lives of the\n",
      "select people around us who, through winning success, achievement, and\n",
      "happiness, prove that thinking big does work magic.\n",
      "The simple steps we have set down here are not untested theories. They\n",
      "are not one man’s guesses and opinions. They are proven approaches to\n",
      "life’s situations, and they are universally applicable steps that work and\n",
      "work like magic.\n",
      "That you’re reading this page proves you are interested in larger success.\n",
      "You want to fulfill your desires. You want to enjoy a fine standard of living.\n",
      "You want this life to deliver to you all the good things you deserve. Being\n",
      "interested in success is a wonderful quality.\n",
      "You have another admirable quality. The fact that you’re holding this\n",
      "book in your hands shows you have the intelligence to look for tools that\n",
      "will help take you where you want to go. In building anything—\n",
      "automobiles, bridges, missiles—we need tools. Many people, in their\n",
      "attempt to build a successful life, forget there are tools to help them. You\n",
      "have not forgotten. You have, then, the two basic qualities needed to realize\n",
      "real profit from this book: a desire for greater success and the intelligence to\n",
      "select a tool to help you realize that desire.\n",
      "Think Big and you’ll live big. You’ll live big in happiness. You’ll live big\n",
      "in accomplishment. Big in income. Big in friends. Big in respect.\n",
      "Enough for the promise.\n",
      "Start now, right now, to discover how to make your thinking make magic\n",

      "‘Mountain, move away.’ It’s simply impossible.”\n",
      "People who think this way have belief confused with wishful thinking.\n",

      "There is nothing magical or mystical about the power of belief.\n",
      "Belief works this way. Belief, the “I’m-positive-I-can” attitude, generates\n",

      "Every day all over the nation young people start working in new jobs.\n",
      "Each of them “wishes” that someday he could enjoy the success that goes\n",
      "with reaching the top. But the majority of these young people simply don’t\n",
      "have the belief that it takes to reach the top rungs. And they don’t reach the\n",
      "top. Believing it’s impossible to climb high, they do not discover the steps\n",
      "that lead to great heights. Their behavior remains that of the “average”\n",
      "person.\n",
      "But a small number of these young people really believe they will\n",
      "succeed. They approach their work with the “I’m-going-to the-top” attitude.\n",
      "And with substantial belief they reach the top. Believing they will succeed\n",
      "—and that it’s not impossible—these folks study and observe the behavior\n",
      "of senior executives. They learn how successful people approach problems\n",
      "and make decisions. They observe the attitudes of successful people.\n",
      "The how-to-do-it always comes to the person who believes he can do it.\n",
      "A young woman I’m acquainted with decided two years ago that she was\n",
      "going to establish a sales agency to sell mobile homes. She was advised by\n",
      "many that she shouldn’t—and couldn’t—do it.\n",
      "She had less than $3,000 in savings and was advised that the minimum\n",
      "capital investment required was many times that.\n",
      "“Look how competitive it is,” she was advised. “And besides, what\n",
      "practical experience have you had in selling mobile homes, let alone\n",
      "managing a business?” her advisors asked.\n",
      "But this young lady had belief in herself and her ability to succeed. She\n",
      "quickly admitted that she lacked capital, that the business was very\n",
      "competitive, and that she lacked experience.\n",
      "“But,” she said, “all the evidence I can gather shows that the mobile\n",
      "home industry is going to expand. On top of that, I’ve studied my\n",

      "much, but it was written all over her that she was more resigned to her fate\n",

      "seeing my weak point for the first time. I discovered that I had held back. I\n",
      "had always carried a little stick. I dug into myself deeper and deeper and\n",
      "found the reason I lacked initiative was because I didn’t believe inside that I\n",
      "was worth very much.\n",
      "“I sat there the rest of the night just reviewing how lack of faith in myself\n",
      "had dominated me ever since I could remember, how I had used my mind to\n",

      "saleable.\n",
      "“Within two years after I took that job I had established a reputation as\n",
      "the fellow who can get business. Then we went into a recession. This made\n",
      "me still more valuable because I was one of the best business-getters in the\n",

      "Both Mr. Triumph and Mr. Defeat are intensely obedient. They snap to\n",
      "attention immediately. All you need do to signal either foreman is to give\n",

      "step forward and go to work. Likewise, a negative signal brings Mr. Defeat\n",
      "forward.\n",
      "To see how these two foremen work for you, try this example. Tell\n",
      "yourself, “Today is a lousy day.” This signals Mr. Defeat into action, and he\n",
      "manufactures some facts to prove you are right. He suggests to you that it’s\n",
      "too hot or it’s too cold, business will be bad today, sales will drop, other\n",
      "people will be on edge, you may get sick. Mr. Defeat is tremendously\n",

      "you know it, it is a heck of a bad day.\n",
      "But tell yourself, “Today is a fine day,” and Mr. Triumph is signaled\n",
      "forward to act. He tells you, “This is a wonderful day. The weather is\n",
      "refreshing. It’s good to be alive. Today you can catch up on some of your\n",

      "show you more reasons why you like Tom.\n",
      "Now; the more work you give either of these two foremen, the stronger\n",
      "he becomes. If Mr. Defeat is given more work to do, he adds personnel and\n",

      "BELIEF\n",
      "Here are the three guides to acquiring and strengthening the power of\n",
      "belief:\n",
      "1. Think success, don’t think failure. At work, in your home, substitute\n",
      "success thinking for failure thinking. When you face a difficult situation,\n",
      "think, “I’ll win,” not “I’ll probably lose.” When you compete with\n",
      "someone else, think, “I’m equal to the best,” not “I’m outclassed.” When\n",
      "opportunity appears, think “I can do it,” never “I can’t.” Let the master\n",
      "thought “I will succeed” dominate your thinking process. Thinking\n",
      "success conditions your mind to create plans that produce success.\n",
      "Thinking failure does the exact opposite. Failure thinking conditions the\n",
      "mind to think other thoughts that produce failure.\n",
      "2. Remind yourself regularly that you are better than you think you are.\n",
      "Successful people are not supermen. Success does not require a\n",
      "superintellect. Nor is there anything mystical about success. And success\n",
      "isn’t based on luck. Successful people are just ordinary folks who have\n",
      "developed belief in themselves and what they do. Never—yes, never—\n",
      "sell yourself short.\n",
      "3. Believe Big. The size of your success is determined by the size of your\n",
      "belief. Think little goals and expect little achievements. Think big goals\n",
      "and win big success. Remember this, too! Big ideas and big plans are\n",

      "order a man to develop…. Whether a man lags behind or moves ahead in\n",

      "The what of your personal training program for success is built on the\n",
      "attitudes and techniques of successful people. How do they manage\n",

      "you success and on a scale that may now look impossible. Broken down\n",
      "into its components, your personal training program for success will bring\n",

      "disease are health excusitis, intelligence excusitis, age excusitis, and luck\n",
      "excusitis. Now let’s see just how we can protect ourselves from these four\n",
      "common ailments.\n",
      "1. “But My Health Isn’t Good.”\n",
      "Health excusitis ranges all the way from the chronic “I don’t feel good” to\n",
      "the more specific “I’ve got such-and-such wrong with me.”\n",
      "“Bad” health, in a thousand different forms, is used as an excuse for\n",
      "failing to do what a person wants to do, failing to accept greater\n",
      "responsibilities, failing to make more money, failing to achieve success.\n",
      "Millions and millions of people suffer from health excusitis. But is it, in\n",
      "most cases, a legitimate excuse? Think for a moment of all the highly\n",
      "successful people you know who could—but who don’t—use health as an\n",
      "excuse.\n",
      "My physician and surgeon friends tell me the perfect specimen of adult\n",
      "life is nonexistent. There is something physically wrong with everybody.\n",
      "Many surrender in whole or in part to health excusitis, but success-thinking\n",
      "people do not.\n",
      "Two experiences happened to me in one afternoon that illustrate the\n",
      "correct and incorrect attitudes toward health. I had just finished a talk in\n",
      "Cleveland. Afterwards, one fellow, about thirty, asked to speak to me\n",
      "privately for a few minutes. He complimented me on the meeting but then\n",
      "said, “I’m afraid your ideas can’t do me much good.”\n",
      "“You see,” he continued, “I’ve got a bad heart, and I’ve got to hold\n",
      "myself in check.” He went on to explain that he’d seen four doctors but they\n",
      "couldn’t find his trouble. He asked me what I would suggest he do.\n",
      "“Well,” I said, “I know nothing about the heart, but as one layman to\n",
      "another, here are three things I’d do. First, I’d visit the finest heart specialist\n",
      "I could find and accept his diagnosis as final. You’ve already checked with\n",
      "four doctors, and none of them has found anything peculiar with your heart.\n",
      "Let the fifth doctor be your final check. It may very well be you’ve got a\n",
      "perfectly sound heart. But if you keep on worrying about it, eventually you\n",
      "may have a very serious heart ailment. Looking and looking and looking for\n",
      "an illness often actually produces illness.\n",
      "“The second thing I’d recommend is that you read Dr. Schindler’s great\n",

      "practicing law, rearing a fine family, and really enjoying life. My friend,\n",

      "fellow might as well have been dead.”\n",
      "I had to leave at that point, because I had to be on a certain plane for\n",
      "Detroit. On the plane the second but much more pleasant experience\n",
      "occurred. After the noise of the takeoff, I heard a ticking sound. Rather\n",
      "startled, I glanced at the fellow sitting beside me, for the sound seemed to\n",
      "be coming from him.\n",
      "He smiled a big smile and said, “Oh, it’s not a bomb. It’s just my heart.”\n",
      "I was obviously surprised, so he proceeded to tell me what had happened.\n",
      "Just twenty-one days before, he had undergone an operation that involved\n",
      "putting a plastic valve into his heart. The ticking sound, he explained,\n",
      "would continue for several months, until new tissue had grown over the\n",
      "artificial valve. I asked him what he was going to do.\n",
      "“Oh,” he said, “I’ve got big plans. I’m going to study law when I get\n",
      "back to Minnesota. Someday I hope to be in government work. The doctors\n",

      "There you have two ways of meeting health problems. The first fellow,\n",
      "not even sure he had anything organically wrong with him, was worried,\n",
      "depressed, on the road to defeat, wanting somebody to second his motion\n",
      "that he couldn’t go forward. The second individual, after undergoing one of\n",
      "the most difficult of operations, was optimistic, eager to do something. The\n",
      "difference lay in how they thought toward health!\n",
      "I’ve had some very direct experience with health excusitis. I’m a\n",
      "diabetic. Right after I discovered I had this ailment (about 5,000\n",
      "hypodermics ago), I was warned, “Diabetes is a physical condition; but the\n",
      "biggest damage results from having a negative attitude toward it. Worry\n",
      "about it, and you may have real trouble.” Naturally, since the discovery of\n",
      "my own diabetes, I’ve gotten to know a great many other diabetics. Let me\n",
      "tell you about two extremes. One fellow who has a very mild case belongs\n",
      "to that fraternity of the living dead. Obsessed with a fear of the weather, he\n",
      "is usually ridiculously bundled up. He’s afraid of infection, so he shuns\n",
      "anybody who has the slightest sniffle. He’s afraid of overexertion, so he\n",
      "does almost nothing. He spends most of his mental energy worrying about\n",
      "what might happen. He bores other people telling them “how awful” his\n",
      "problem really is. His real ailment is not diabetes. Rather, he’s a victim of\n",
      "health excusitis. He has pitied himself into being an invalid.\n",
      "The other extreme is a division manager for a large publishing company.\n",
      "He has a severe case; he takes about thirty times as much insulin as the\n",
      "fellow mentioned above. But he is not living to be sick. He is living to\n",
      "enjoy his work and have fun. One day he said to me, “Sure it is an\n",
      "inconvenience, but so is shaving. But I’m not going to think myself to bed.\n",
      "When I take those shots, I just praise the guys who discovered insulin.”\n",
      "A good friend of mine, a widely known college educator, came home\n",
      "from Europe in 1945 minus one arm. Despite his handicap, John is always\n",
      "smiling, always helping others. He’s about as optimistic as anyone I know.\n",
      "One day he and I had a long talk about his handicap.\n",
      "“It’s just an arm,” he said, “Sure, two are better than one. But they just\n",
      "cut off my arm. My spirit is one hundred percent intact. I’m really grateful\n",
      "for that.”\n",
      "Another amputee friend is an excellent golfer. One day I asked him how\n",
      "he had been able to develop such a near-perfect style with just one arm. I\n",
      "mentioned that most golfers with two arms can’t do nearly as well. His\n",
      "reply says a lot. “Well, it’s my experience,” he said, “that the right attitude\n",
      "and one arm will beat the wrong attitude and two arms every time.” The\n",
      "right attitude and one arm will beat the wrong attitude and two arms every\n",
      "time. Think about that for a while. It holds true not only on the golf course\n",
      "but in every facet of life.\n",
      "FOUR THINGS YOU CAN DO TO KICK HEALTH EXCUSITIS\n",
      "The best vaccine against health excusitis consists of these four doses:\n",
      "1. Refuse to talk about your health. The more you talk about an ailment,\n",
      "even the common cold, the worse it seems to get. Talking about bad\n",
      "health is like putting fertilizer on weeds. Besides, talking about your\n",
      "health is a bad habit. It bores people. It makes one appear self-centered\n",
      "and old-maidish. Success-minded people defeat the natural tendency to\n",
      "talk about their “bad” health. One may (and let me emphasize the word\n",
      "may) get a little sympathy, but one doesn’t get respect and loyalty by\n",
      "being a chronic complainer.\n",
      "2. Refuse to worry about your health. Dr. Walter Alvarez, emeritus\n",
      "consultant to the world-famous Mayo Clinic, wrote, “I always beg\n",
      "worriers to exercise some self-control. For instance, when I saw this man\n",
      "(a fellow who was convinced he had a diseased gallbladder although\n",
      "eight separate X-ray examinations showed that the organ was perfectly\n",
      "normal), I begged him to quit getting his gallbladder X-rayed. I have\n",
      "begged \n",
      "hundreds \n",
      "of \n",
      "heart-conscious \n",
      "men \n",
      "to \n",
      "quit \n",
      "getting\n",
      "electrocardiograms made.”\n",
      "3. Be genuinely grateful that your health is as good as it is. There’s an old\n",
      "saying worth repeating often: “I felt sorry for myself because I had\n",
      "ragged shoes until I met a man who had no feet.” Instead of complaining\n",
      "about “not feeling good,” it’s far better to be glad you are as healthy as\n",
      "you are. Just being grateful for the health you have is powerful\n",
      "vaccination against developing new aches and pains and real illness.\n",
      "4. Remind yourself often, “It’s better to wear out than rust out.” Life is\n",
      "yours to enjoy. Don’t waste it. Don’t pass up living by thinking yourself\n",
      "into a hospital bed.\n",
      "2. “But You’ve Got to Have Brains to Succeed.”\n",
      "Intelligence excusitis, or “I lack brains,” is common. In fact, it’s so common\n",
      "that perhaps as many as 95 percent of the people around us have it in\n",
      "varying degrees. Unlike most other types of excusitis, people suffering from\n",
      "this particular type of the malady suffer in silence. Not many people will\n",
      "admit openly that they think they lack adequate intelligence. Rather, they\n",
      "feel it deep down inside.\n",
      "Most of us make two basic errors with respect to intelligence:\n",
      "1. We underestimate our own brainpower.\n",
      "2. We overestimate the other fellow’s brainpower.\n",
      "Because of these errors many people sell themselves short. They fail to\n",
      "tackle challenging situations because it “takes a brain.” But along comes the\n",
      "fellow who isn’t concerned about intelligence, and he gets the job.\n",
      "What really matters is not how much intelligence you have but how you\n",
      "use what you do have. The thinking that guides your intelligence is much\n",
      "more important than the quantity of your brainpower. Let me repeat, for this\n",
      "is vitally important: the thinking that guides your intelligence is much more\n",
      "important than how much intelligence you may have.\n",
      "In answering the question, “Should your child be a scientist?” Dr.\n",
      "Edward Teller, one of the nation’s foremost physicists, said, “A child does\n",
      "not need a lightning-fast mind to be a scientist, nor does he need a\n",
      "miraculous memory, nor is it necessary that he get very high grades in\n",
      "school. The only point that counts is that the child have a high degree of\n",
      "interest in science.”\n",
      "Interest, enthusiasm, is the critical factor even in science!\n",
      "With a positive, optimistic, and cooperative attitude a person with an IQ\n",
      "of 100 will earn more money, win more respect, and achieve more success\n",
      "than a negative, pessimistic, uncooperative individual with an IQ of 120.\n",
      "Just enough sense to stick with something—a chore, task, project—until\n",
      "it’s completed pays off much better than idle intelligence, even if idle\n",

      "For stickability is 95 percent of ability.\n",
      "At a homecoming celebration last year I met a college friend whom I had\n",

      "western Nebraska.\n",
      "I asked Chuck what kind of business he finally established.\n",

      "ready to talk about it.\n",

      "unsuccessful people I know. He has a very mediocre job (he’s afraid of\n",
      "responsibility). He has never married (lots of marriages end in divorce). He\n",
      "has few friends (people bore him). He’s never invested in property of any\n",
      "kind (he might lose his money). This man uses his great brainpower to\n",
      "prove why things won’t work rather than directing his mental power to\n",
      "searching for ways to succeed.\n",
      "Because of the negative thinking that guides his great reservoir of brains,\n",
      "this fellow contributes little and creates nothing. With a changed attitude, he\n",

      "can override this basic success principle!\n",
      "Several years ago I became a close friend of Phil F., one of the senior\n",
      "officers of a major advertising agency. Phil was director of marketing\n",
      "research for the agency, and he was doing a bang-up job.\n",
      "Was Phil a “brain”? Far from it. Phil knew next to nothing about research\n",
      "technique. He knew next to nothing about statistics. He was not a college\n",
      "graduate (though all the people working for him were). And Phil did not\n",

      "Not Phil’s brains, but how he managed those brains, made him three\n",
      "times more valuable to his company than men who rated higher on the IQ\n",
      "scale.\n",
      "Out of every 100 persons who enroll in college, fewer than 50 will\n",
      "graduate. I was curious about this so I asked a director of admissions at a\n",
      "large university for his explanation.\n",
      "“It’s not insufficient intelligence,” he said. “We don’t admit them if they\n",
      "don’t have sufficient ability. And it’s not money. Anyone who wants to\n",
      "support himself in college today can do so. The real reason is attitudes. You\n",

      "don’t like their professors, the subjects they must take, and their fellow\n",
      "students.”\n",
      "The same reason, negative thinking, explains why the door to top-flight\n",

      "THREE WAYS TO CURE INTELLIGENCE EXCUSITIS\n",
      "Three easy ways to cure intelligence excusitis are:\n",
      "1. Never underestimate your own intelligence, and never overestimate the\n",
      "intelligence of others. Don’t sell yourself short. Concentrate on your\n",
      "assets. Discover your superior talents. Remember, it’s not how many\n",
      "brains you’ve got that matters. Rather, it’s how you use your brains that\n",
      "counts. Manage your brains instead of worrying about how much IQ\n",
      "you’ve got.\n",
      "2. Remind yourself several times daily, “My attitudes are more important\n",
      "than my intelligence.” At work and at home practice positive attitudes.\n",
      "See the reasons why you can do it, not the reasons why you can’t.\n",
      "Develop an “I’m winning” attitude. Put your intelligence to creative\n",
      "positive use. Use it to find ways to win, not to prove you will lose.\n",
      "3. Remember that the ability to think is of much greater value than the\n",
      "ability to memorize facts. Use your mind to create and develop ideas, to\n",
      "find new and better ways to do things. Ask yourself, “Am I using my\n",
      "mental ability to make history, or am I using it merely to record history\n",
      "made by others?”\n",
      "3. “It’s No Use. I’m Too Old (or Too Young).”\n",
      "Age excusitis, the failure disease of never being the right age, comes in two\n",
      "easily identifiable forms: the “I’m too old” variety and the “I’m too young”\n",
      "brand.\n",
      "You’ve heard hundreds of people of all ages explain their mediocre\n",

      "And it’s unfortunate. This excuse has closed the door of real opportunity to\n",

      "appeal to many worried minds looking for an excuse.\n",
      "HOW TO HANDLE AGE EXCUSITIS\n",
      "Age excusitis can be cured. A few years ago, while I was conducting a sales\n",
      "training program, I discovered a good serum that both cures this disease and\n",
      "vaccinates you so you won’t get it in the first place.\n",
      "In that training program there was a trainee named Cecil. Cecil, who was\n",
      "forty, wanted to shift over to set himself up as a manufacturer’s\n",
      "representative, but he thought he was too old. “After all,” he explained, “I’d\n",
      "have to start from scratch. And I’m too old for that now. I’m forty.”\n",
      "I talked with Cecil several times about his “old age” problem. I used the\n",
      "old medicine, “You’re only as old as you feel,” but I found I was getting\n",
      "nowhere.(Too often people retort with “But I do feel old!”)\n",
      "Finally, I discovered a method that worked. One day after a training\n",
      "session, I tried it on Cecil. I said, “Cecil, when does a man’s productive life\n",
      "begin?”\n",
      "He thought a couple of seconds and answered, “Oh, when he’s about\n",
      "twenty, I guess.”\n",
      "“Okay,” I said, “now, when does a man’s productive life end?”\n",
      "Cecil answered, “Well, if he stays in good shape and likes his work, I\n",
      "guess a man is still pretty useful when he’s seventy or so.”\n",
      "“All right,” I said, “a lot of folks are highly productive after they reach\n",
      "seventy, but let’s agree with what you’ve just said, a man’s productive years\n",
      "stretch from twenty to seventy. That’s fifty years in between, or half a\n",
      "century. Cecil,” I said, “you’re forty. How many years of productive life\n",
      "have you spent?”\n",
      "“Twenty,” he answered.\n",
      "“And how many have you left?”\n",
      "“Thirty” he replied.\n",
      "“In other words, Cecil, you haven’t even reached the halfway point;\n",
      "you’ve used up only 40 percent of your productive years.”\n",
      "I looked at Cecil and realized he’d gotten the point. He was cured of age\n",
      "excusitis. Cecil saw he still had many opportunityfilled years left. He\n",
      "switched from thinking “I’m already old” to “I’m still young.” Cecil now\n",
      "realized that how old we are is not important. It’s one’s attitude toward age\n",
      "that makes it a blessing or a barricade.\n",
      "Curing yourself of age excusitis often opens doors to opportunities that\n",
      "you thought were locked tight. A relative of mine spent years doing many\n",
      "different things—selling, operating his own business, working in a bank—\n",
      "but he never quite found what he really wanted to do most. Finally, he\n",
      "concluded that the one thing he wanted more than anything else was to be a\n",
      "minister. But when he thought about it, he found he was too old. After all,\n",
      "he was forty-five, had three young children and little money.\n",
      "But fortunately he mustered all of his strength and told himself, “Forty-\n",
      "five or not, I’m going to be a minister.”\n",
      "With tons of faith but little else, he enrolled in a five-year ministerial\n",
      "training program in Wisconsin. Five years later he was ordained as a\n",
      "minister and settled down with a fine congregation in Illinois.\n",
      "Old? Of course not. He still has twenty years of productive life ahead of\n",
      "him. I talked with this man not long ago, and he said to me, “You know, if I\n",
      "had not made that great decision when I was forty-five, I would have spent\n",
      "the rest of my life growing old and bitter. Now I feel every bit as young as I\n",
      "did twenty-five years ago.”\n",
      "And he almost looked it, too. When you kick age excusitis, the natural\n",
      "result is to gain the optimism of youth and feel of youth. When you beat\n",
      "down your fears of age limitations, you add years to your life as well as\n",
      "success.\n",
      "A former university colleague of mine provides an interesting angle on\n",
      "how age excusitis was defeated. Bill was graduated from Harvard in the\n",
      "1920s. After twenty-four years in the stockbrokerage business, during\n",
      "which time he made a modest fortune, Bill decided he wanted to become a\n",
      "college professor. Bill’s friends warned him that he would overtax himself\n",
      "in the rugged learning program ahead. But Bill was determined to reach his\n",
      "goal and enrolled in the University of Illinois—at the age of fifty-one. At\n",
      "fifty-five he had earned his degree. Today Bill is chairman of the\n",
      "Department of Economics at a fine liberal arts college. He’s happy, too. He\n",
      "smiles when he says, “I’ve got almost a third of my good years left.”\n",
      "Old age is a failure disease. Defeat it by refusing to let it hold you back.\n",
      "When is a person too young? The “I’m too young” variety of age\n",
      "excusitis does much damage, too. About a year ago, a twenty-three-year-old\n",
      "fellow named Jerry came to me with a problem. Jerry was a fine young\n",
      "man. He had been a paratrooper in the service and then had gone to college.\n",
      "While going to college, Jerry supported his wife and son by selling for a\n",
      "large transfer and-storage company. He had done a terrific job, both in\n",
      "college and for his company.\n",
      "But today Jerry was worried. “Dr. Schwartz,” he said, “I’ve got a\n",
      "problem. My company has offered me the job of sales manager. This would\n",
      "make me supervisor over eight salesmen.” “Congratulations, that’s\n",
      "wonderful news!” I said. “But you seem worried.”\n",
      "“Well,” he continued, “all eight men I’m to supervise are from seven to\n",
      "twenty-one years older than I. What do you think I should do? Can I handle\n",
      "it?”\n",
      "“Jerry,” I said, “the general manager of your company obviously thinks\n",
      "you’re old enough or he wouldn’t have offered you this job. Just remember\n",
      "these three points and everything will work out just fine: first, don’t be age\n",
      "conscious. Back on the farm a boy became a man when he proved he could\n",
      "do the work of a man. His number of birthdays had nothing to do with it.\n",
      "And this applies to you. When you prove you are able to handle the job of\n",
      "sales manager, you’re automatically old enough.\n",
      "“Second, don’t take advantage of your new ‘gold bars’. Show respect for\n",
      "the salesmen. Ask them for their suggestions. Make them feel they are\n",
      "working for a team captain, not a dictator. Do this and the men will work\n",
      "with you, not against you.\n",
      "“Third, get used to having older persons working for you. Leaders in all\n",
      "fields soon find they are younger than many of the people they supervise.\n",
      "So get used to having older men work for you. It will help you a lot in the\n",
      "coming years, when even bigger opportunities develop.\n",
      "“And remember, Jerry, your age won’t be a handicap unless you make it\n",
      "one.”\n",
      "Today Jerry’s doing fine. He loves the transportation business, and now\n",
      "he’s planning to organize his own company in a few years.\n",
      "Youth is a liability only when the youth thinks it is. You often hear that\n",
      "certain jobs require “considerable” physical maturity, jobs like selling\n",
      "securities and insurance. That you’ve got to have either gray hair or no hair\n",
      "at all in order to gain an investor’s confidence is plain nonsense. What\n",
      "really matters is how well you know your job. If you know your job and\n",
      "understand people, you’re sufficiently mature to handle it. Age has no real\n",
      "relation to ability, unless you convince yourself that years alone will give\n",
      "you the stuff you need to make your mark.\n",
      "Many young people feel that they are being held back because of their\n",
      "youth. Now, it is true that another person in an organization who is insecure\n",
      "and job-scared may try to block your way forward, using age or some other\n",
      "reason.\n",
      "But the people who really count in the company will not.\n",
      "They will give you as much responsibility as they feel you can handle\n",
      "well. Demonstrate that you have ability and positive attitudes and your\n",
      "youthfulness will be considered an advantage.\n",
      "In quick recap, the cure for age excusitis is:\n",
      "1. Look at your present age positively. Think, “I’m still young,” not “I’m\n",
      "already old.” Practice looking forward to new horizons and gain the\n",
      "enthusiasm and the feel of youth.\n",
      "2. Compute how much productive time you have left. Remember, a person\n",
      "age thirty still has 80 percent of his productive life ahead of him. And the\n",
      "fifty-year-old still has a big 40 percent—the best 40 percent—of his\n",
      "opportunity years left. Life is actually longer than most people think!\n",
      "3. Invest future time in doing what you really want to do. It’s too late only\n",
      "when you let your mind go negative and think it’s too late. Stop thinking\n",
      "“I should have started years ago.” That’s failure thinking. Instead think,\n",
      "“I’m going to start now, my best years are ahead of me.” That’s the way\n",
      "successful people think.\n",

      "working harder. He had a more effective personality.\n",
      "I also knew that the senior officers in the company had spent much time\n",

      "“Well, the pattern is against me. Sales figures in my department are off\n",
      "seven percent from a year ago. This is pretty bad, especially since the\n",
      "store’s total sales are up six percent. I’ve made a couple of unwise decisions\n",
      "recently, and I’ve been singled out several times by the merchandise\n",
      "manager for not keeping pace with the company’s progress.\n",
      "“I’ve never felt quite like this before,” he continued. “I’ve lost my grip,\n",
      "and it shows. My assistant buyer senses it. The sales people see it, too.\n",
      "Other executives, of course, are aware that I’m slipping. One buyer even\n",
      "suggested at a meeting of all head buyers the other day that part of my line\n",
      "should be put in his department, where, he said, ‘It could make money for\n",
      "the store.’ It’s like drowning and having a crowd of spectators just standing\n",
      "there waiting for me to sink away.”\n",
      "The executive talked on, elaborating further on his predicament. Finally I\n",
      "cut in and asked, “What are you doing about it? What are you trying to do\n",
      "to correct the situation?”\n",
      "“Well,” he answered, “there isn’t much I can do, I guess, but hope for the\n",
      "best.”\n",
      "To this comment I asked, “Honestly, now, is hope enough?” Pausing, but\n",
      "not giving him a chance to answer, I put another question to him: “Why not\n",
      "take action to support your hope?”\n",
      "“Go on,” he said.\n",
      "“Well, there are two kinds of action that seem to fit your case. First, start\n",
      "this afternoon to move those sales figures upward. We’ve got to face it.\n",
      "There’s a reason your sales are slipping. Find it. Maybe you need a special\n",
      "sale to clear out your slow-moving merchandise, so you’ll be in a position\n",
      "to buy some fresh stock. Perhaps you can rearrange your display counters.\n",
      "Maybe your salespeople need more enthusiasm. I can’t pin point what will\n",
      "turn your sales volume upward, but something will. And it would probably\n",
      "be wise to talk privately with your merchandise manager. He may be on the\n",
      "verge of putting you out, but when you talk it over with him and ask his\n",
      "advice, he’ll certainly give you more time to work things out. It’s too\n",
      "expensive for the store to replace you as long as top management feels\n",
      "there’s a chance you’ll find a solution.”\n",
      "I went on, “Then get your assistant buyers on the ball. Quit acting like a\n",
      "drowning man. Let people around you know that you’re still alive.”\n",
      "Courage was again in his eyes. Then he asked, “You said there are two\n",
      "kinds of action I should take. What’s the second?”\n",
      "“The second type of action, which you might say is an insurance policy,\n",
      "is to let two or three of your closest business friends in the trade know you\n",
      "might consider an offer from another store, assuming, of course, it is\n",
      "substantially better than your present job.\n",
      "“I don’t believe your job will be insecure after you take some affirmative\n",
      "action to get those sales figures on the rise. But just in case, it’s good to\n",
      "have an offer or two. Remember, it’s ten times easier for a man with a job to\n",
      "get another job than it is for someone unemployed to connect.”\n",
      "Two days ago this once-troubled executive called me.\n",
      "“After our talk I buckled down. I made a number of changes, but the\n",
      "most basic one was with my salespeople. I used to hold sales meetings once\n",
      "a week, but now I’m holding one every morning. I’ve got those people\n",
      "really enthusiastic. I guess once they saw some life in me they were ready\n",
      "to push harder too. They were just waiting for me to start things moving\n",
      "again.\n",
      "“Things sure are working out okay. Last week my sales were well ahead\n",
      "of a year ago and much better than the store’s average.\n",

      "face a difficult decision. Can you supply me with any thoughts which will\n",

      "Here are two specific things to do to build confidence through efficient\n",
      "management of your memory bank.\n",
      "1. Deposit only positive thoughts in your memory bank. Let’s face it\n",
      "squarely: everyone encounters plenty of unpleasant, embarrassing, and\n",
      "discouraging situations. But unsuccessful and successful people deal with\n",
      "these situations in directly opposite ways. Unsuccessful people take them\n",
      "to heart, so to speak. They dwell on the unpleasant situations, thereby\n",
      "giving them a good start in their memory. They don’t take their minds\n",
      "away from them. At night the unpleasant situation is the last thing they\n",
      "think about.\n",
      "Confident, successful people, on the other hand, “don’t give it another\n",
      "thought.” Successful people specialize in putting positive thoughts into their\n",
      "memory bank.\n",
      "What kind of performance would your car deliver if every morning\n",
      "before you left for work you scooped up a double handful of dirt and put it\n",
      "into your crankcase? That fine engine would soon be a mess, unable to do\n",
      "what you want it to do. Negative, unpleasant thoughts deposited in your\n",
      "mind affect your mind the same way. Negative thoughts produce needless\n",
      "wear and tear on your mental motor. They create worry, frustration, and\n",
      "feelings of inferiority. They put you beside the road while others drive\n",
      "ahead.\n",
      "Do this: in these moments when you’re alone with your thoughts—when\n",
      "you’re driving your car or eating alone—recall pleasant, positive\n",
      "experiences. Put good thoughts in your memory bank. This boosts\n",
      "confidence. It gives you that “I-sure-feel-good” feeling. It helps keep your\n",
      "body functioning right, too.\n",
      "Here is an excellent plan. Just before you go to sleep, deposit good\n",
      "thoughts in your memory bank. Count your blessings. Recall the many good\n",
      "things you have to be thankful for: your wife or husband, your children,\n",
      "your friends, your health. Recall the good things you saw people do today.\n",
      "Recall your little victories and accomplishments. Go over the reasons why\n",
      "you are glad to be alive.\n",
      "2. Withdraw only positive thoughts from your memory bank. I was closely\n",
      "associated several years ago in Chicago with a firm of psychological\n",
      "consultants. They handled many types of cases, but mostly marriage\n",
      "problems and psychological adjustment situations, all dealing with mind\n",
      "matters.\n",
      "One afternoon as I was talking with the head of the firm about his\n",
      "profession and his techniques for helping the seriously maladjusted person,\n",
      "he made this remark: “You know, there would be no need for my services if\n",
      "people would do just one thing.”\n",
      "“What’s that?” I asked eagerly.\n",
      "“Simply this: destroy their negative thoughts before those thoughts\n",
      "become mental monsters.”\n",
      "“Most individuals I try to help,” he continued, “are operating their own\n",
      "private museum of mental horror. Many marriage difficulties, for example,\n",
      "involve the ‘honeymoon monster.’ The honeymoon wasn’t as satisfactory as\n",
      "one or both of the marriage partners had hoped, but instead of burying the\n",
      "memory, they reflected on it hundreds of times until it was a giant obstacle\n",
      "to successful marital relationships. They come to me as much as five or ten\n",
      "years later.\n",
      "“Usually, of course, my clients don’t see where their trouble lies. It’s my\n",
      "job to uncover and explain the source of their difficulty to them and help\n",
      "them to see what a triviality it really is.\n",
      "“A person can make a mental monster out of almost any unpleasant\n",
      "happening,” my psychologist friend went on. “A job failure, a jilted\n",
      "romance, a bad investment, disappointment in the behavior of a teenage\n",
      "child—these are common monsters I have to help troubled people destroy.”\n",
      "It is clear that any negative thought, if fertilized with repeated recall, can\n",
      "develop into a real mind monster, breaking down confidence and paving the\n",
      "way to serious psychological difficulties.\n",
      "In an article in Cosmopolitan magazine some years ago, “The Drive\n",
      "Toward Self-Destruction,” Alice Mulcahey pointed out that upward of\n",
      "30,000 Americans commit suicide each year and another 100,000 attempt to\n",
      "take their own lives. She went on to say, “There is shocking evidence that\n",
      "millions of other people are killing themselves by slower, less obvious\n",
      "methods. Still others are committing spiritual rather than physical suicide,\n",
      "constantly seeking out ways to humiliate, punish, and generally diminish\n",
      "themselves.”\n",
      "The psychologist friend mentioned before told me how he helped one of\n",
      "his patients to stop committing “mental and spiritual suicide.” “This\n",
      "patient,” he explained, “was in her late thirties and had two children. In lay\n",
      "terminology she suffered from severe depression. She looked back on every\n",
      "incident of her life as being an unhappy experience. Her school days, her\n",
      "marriage, the bearing of her children, the places she had lived all were\n",
      "thought of negatively. She volunteered that she couldn’t remember ever\n",
      "having been truly happy. And since what one remembers from the past\n",
      "colors what one sees in the present, she saw nothing but pessimism and\n",
      "darkness.\n",
      "“When I asked her what she saw in a picture which I showed her, she\n",
      "said, ‘It looks like there will be a terrible thunderstorm tonight.’ That was\n",
      "the gloomiest interpretation of the picture I’ve yet heard.” (The picture was\n",
      "a large oil painting of the sun low in the sky and a jagged, rocky coastline.\n",
      "The painting was very cleverly done and could be construed to be either a\n",
      "sunrise or a sunset. The psychologist commented to me that what a person\n",
      "sees in the picture is a clue to his personality. Most people say it is a\n",
      "sunrise. But the depressed person nearly always says it’s a sunset.)\n",
      "“As a psychologist, I can’t change what already is in a person’s memory.\n",
      "But I can, with the patient’s cooperation, help the individual to see his past\n",
      "in a different light. That’s the general treatment I used on this woman. I\n",
      "worked with her to help her to see joy and pleasure in her past instead of\n",
      "total disappointment. After six months she began to show improvement. At\n",
      "that point, I gave her a special assignment. Each day I asked her to think of\n",
      "and write down three specific reasons she has to be happy. Then at her next\n",
      "appointment with me on Thursdays I’d go over her list with her. I continued\n",
      "this sort of treatment for three months. Her improvement was very\n",
      "satisfactory. Today that woman is very well adjusted to her situation. She’s\n",
      "positive and certainly as happy as most people.”\n",
      "When this woman quit drawing negatives from her memory bank, she\n",
      "was headed toward recovery.\n",
      "Whether the psychological problem is big or little, the cure comes when\n",
      "one learns to quit drawing negatives from one’s memory bank and\n",
      "withdraws positives instead.\n",
      "Don’t build mental monsters. Refuse to withdraw the unpleasant thoughts\n",
      "from your memory bank. When you remember situations of any kind,\n",
      "concentrate on the good part of the experience; forget the bad. Bury it. If\n",
      "you find yourself thinking about the negative side, turn your mind off\n",
      "completely.\n",
      "And here is something very significant and very encouraging. Your mind\n",
      "wants you to forget the unpleasant. If you will just cooperate, unpleasant\n",
      "memories will gradually shrivel and the teller in your memory bank will\n",
      "cancel them out.\n",
      "Dr. Melvin S. Hattwick, noted advertising psychologist, in commenting\n",
      "on our ability to remember, says, “When the feeling aroused is pleasant, the\n",
      "advertisement has a better chance to be remembered. When the feeling\n",
      "aroused is unpleasant, the reader or listener tends to forget the\n",
      "advertisement message. The unpleasant runs counter to what we want, we\n",
      "don’t want to remember it.”\n",
      "In brief, it really is easy to forget the unpleasant if we simply refuse to\n",
      "recall it. Withdraw only positive thoughts from your memory bank. Let the\n",
      "others fade away. And your confidence, that feeling of being on top of the\n",
      "world, will zoom upward. You take a big step forward toward conquering\n",
      "fear when you refuse to remember negative, self-deprecating thoughts.\n",
      "Why do people fear other people? Why do many folks feel self-conscious\n",
      "around others? What’s behind shyness? What can we do about it?\n",
      "Fear of other people is a big fear. But there is a way to conquer it. You\n",
      "can conquer fear of people if you will learn to put them into proper\n",
      "perspective.\n",
      "A business friend, who is doing exceptionally well operating his own\n",
      "wood-novelty plant, explained to me how he got the proper perspective of\n",
      "people. His example is interesting.\n",
      "“Before I went into the Army in World War II, I was scared of just about\n",
      "everybody. You just wouldn’t believe how shy and timid I was. I felt\n",
      "everyone else was a lot smarter. I worried about my physical and mental\n",
      "inadequacies. I thought I was born to fail.\n",
      "“Then by some fortunate quirk of fate I lost my fear of people in the\n",
      "Army. During part of 1942 and 1943, when the Army was inducting men at\n",
      "a terrific clip, I was stationed as a medic at one of the big induction centers.\n",
      "Day after day I assisted in examining those men. The more I looked at these\n",
      "recruits, the less afraid of people I became.\n",
      "“All those men lined up by the hundreds, naked as jaybirds, looked so\n",
      "much alike. Oh sure, there were fat ones and skinny ones, tall ones and\n",
      "short ones, but they all were confused, all were lonesome. Just a few days\n",
      "before some of these were rising young executives. Some were farmers,\n",
      "some were salesmen, drifters, blue-collar workers. A few days before they\n",
      "had been many things. But at the induction center they were all alike.\n",
      "“I figured out something pretty basic back then. I discovered people are\n",
      "alike in many, many more ways than · they are different. I discovered the\n",
      "other fellow is pretty much like me. He likes good food, he misses his\n",
      "family and friends, he wants to get ahead, he has problems, he likes to\n",
      "relax. So if the other fellow is basically like me, there’s no point in being\n",
      "afraid of him.”\n",
      "Now, doesn’t that make sense? If the other fellow is basically like me,\n",
      "there’s no reason to be afraid of him.\n",
      "Here are two ways to put people in proper perspective:\n",
      "1. Get a balanced view of the other fellow. Keep these two points in mind\n",
      "when dealing with people: first, the other fellow is important.\n",
      "Emphatically, he is important. Every human being is. But remember this,\n",
      "also: You are important, too. So when you meet another person, make it a\n",
      "policy to think, “We’re just two important people sitting down to discuss\n",
      "something of mutual interest and benefit.”\n",
      "A couple of months ago, a business executive phoned to tell me he had\n",
      "just employed a young man whom I had recommended to him shortly\n",
      "before. “Do you know what really sold me on that fellow?” asked my\n",
      "friend. “What?” I asked. “Well, it was the way he handled himself. Most job\n",
      "applicants when they walk in here are half scared. They give me all the\n",
      "answers they think I want to hear. In a way, most job applicants are a little\n",
      "like beggars—they’ll accept anything, and they aren’t particular.\n",
      "“But G. handled himself differently. He respected me, but what’s just as\n",
      "important, he respects himself. What’s more, he asked me as many\n",
      "questions as I asked him. He’s no mouse. He’s a real man, and he’s going to\n",
      "do all right.”\n",
      "This mutually important attitude helps you keep the situation balanced.\n",
      "The other fellow does not become too important relative to you in your\n",
      "thinking.\n",
      "The other fellow might look frightfully big, frightfully important. But\n",
      "remember, he is still a human being with essentially the same interests,\n",
      "desires, and problems as you.\n",
      "2. Develop an understanding attitude. People who want figuratively to bite\n",
      "you, growl at you, pick on you, and otherwise chop you down are not\n",
      "rare. If you’re not prepared for people like that, they can punch big holes\n",
      "in your confidence and make you feel completely defeated. You need a\n",
      "defense against the adult bully, the fellow who likes to throw his meager\n",
      "weight around.\n",
      "A few months ago, at the reservations desk of a Memphis hotel, I saw an\n",
      "excellent demonstration of the right way to handle folks like this.\n",
      "It was shortly after 5 P.M., and the hotel was busy registering new guests.\n",
      "The fellow ahead of me gave his name to the clerk in a commanding way.\n",
      "The clerk said, “Yes sir, Mr. R., we have a fine single for you.”\n",
      "“Single?” shouted the fellow. “I ordered a double.”\n",
      "The clerk said, very politely, “Let me check, sir.” He pulled the guest’s\n",
      "reservation from the file and said, “I’m sorry, sir. Your telegram specified a\n",
      "single. I’d be happy to put you in a double room, sir, if we had any\n",
      "available. But we simply do not.”\n",
      "Then the irate customer said, “I don’t care what the h—that piece of\n",
      "paper says, I want a double.”\n",
      "Then he started in with that “do-you-know-who-I-am?” bit, followed\n",
      "with “I’ll have you fired. You’ll see, I’ll have you fired.”\n",
      "As best he could, under the verbal tornado, the young clerk injected, “Sir,\n",
      "we’re terribly sorry, but we acted on your instructions.”\n",
      "Finally the customer, really furious now, said, “I wouldn’t stay in the best\n",

      "out.\n",
      "I stepped up to the desk, thinking the clerk, who had taken one of the\n",

      "“Well, sir,” he said, “I really can’t get mad at a fellow like that. You see,\n",
      "he really isn’t mad at me. I was just the scapegoat. The poor fellow may be\n",
      "in bad trouble with his wife, or his business may be off, or maybe he feels\n",
      "inferior and this was his golden chance to feel like a wheel. I’m just the guy\n",

      "Several years ago, while checking student examination papers, I came\n",
      "across one that especially disturbed me. The student who wrote the\n",
      "examination had demonstrated in class discussions and previous tests that\n",
      "he was far better qualified than his paper indicated. He was, in fact, the\n",
      "fellow who I thought would finish at the top of the class. Instead his paper\n",
      "put him at the bottom. As was my custom in such cases, I had my secretary\n",
      "call the student and ask him to come by my office on an urgent matter.\n",
      "Paul W. appeared shortly. He looked as though he had been through a\n",
      "terrible experience. After he was comfortably seated, I said to him, “What\n",
      "happened, Paul? This just isn’t the quality paper I expected you to write.”\n",
      "Paul struggled with himself, looked in the direction of his feet and\n",
      "replied, “Sir, after I saw that you had spotted me cheating, I just went to\n",
      "pieces. I couldn’t concentrate on anything. Honest, this is the first time I’ve\n",
      "ever cheated at the university. I desperately wanted an A, so I worked up a\n",
      "little pony to use.”\n",
      "He was terribly upset. But now that he was talking, he wouldn’t stop. “I\n",
      "suppose you’ll have to recommend me for dismissal. The university rule\n",
      "says any student found cheating in any manner is subject to permanent\n",
      "dismissal.”\n",
      "Here Paul started bringing up the shame this incident would bring to his\n",
      "family, how it would wreck his life, and all sorts of repercussions. Finally I\n",
      "said, “Hold it, now. Slow down. Let me explain something. I didn’t see you\n",
      "cheat. Until you walked in and told me, I hadn’t the faintest idea that was\n",
      "the trouble. I am sorry, Paul, that you did.”\n",
      "Then I continued, “Paul, tell me, just what do you want to gain from your\n",
      "university experience?”\n",
      "He was a little calmer now, and after a short pause he said, “Well, Doctor,\n",
      "I think my overall aim is to learn how to live, but I guess I’m failing pretty\n",
      "badly.”\n",
      "“We learn in different ways,” I said. “I think you can learn a real success\n",
      "lesson from this experience.\n",
      "“When you used your pony in there, your conscience bothered you\n",
      "terribly. This gave you a guilt complex that in turn broke your confidence.\n",
      "As you expressed it, you went to pieces.\n",
      "“Most of the time, Paul, this matter of right and wrong is approached\n",
      "from a moral or religious standpoint. Now, understand, I’m not here to\n",
      "preach to you, give you a sermon about right and wrong. But let’s look at\n",
      "the practical side. When you do anything that goes contrary to your\n",
      "conscience, you feel guilty, and this guilty feeling jams your thought\n",
      "processes. You can’t think straight because your mind is asking ‘Will I get\n",
      "caught? Will I get caught?’\n",
      "“Paul,” I continued, “you wanted an A so badly you did something you\n",
      "knew was wrong. There are many times in life when you’ll want to make an\n",
      "A so badly you’ll be tempted to do something that is contrary to your\n",
      "conscience. For example, someday you may want to make a sale so badly\n",
      "you’ll think of deliberately misleading the customer to buy. And you may\n",
      "succeed. But here’s what will happen. Your guilty feeling will grab hold of\n",
      "you and the next time you see your customer, you’ll be self-conscious, ill at\n",
      "ease. You’ll be wondering ‘Has he discovered that I put something over?’\n",
      "Your presentation will be ineffective because you can’t concentrate.\n",
      "Chances are you’ll never make the second, third, fourth, and the many\n",
      "repeat sales. In the long run, making that sale using tactics that hurt your\n",
      "conscience will cost you a lot of income.”\n",
      "I went on and pointed out to Paul how an occasional business or\n",
      "professional man loses his grip because of an intense fear that his wife will\n",
      "learn about a secret love affair he is having with another woman. “Will she\n",
      "find out? Will she find out?” eats away the man’s confidence until he can’t\n",
      "do a good job at work or in the home.\n",
      "I reminded Paul that many criminals are captured not because any clues\n",
      "point to them but because they act guilty and self-conscious. Their guilt\n",
      "feeling puts them on the suspect list.\n",
      "There is within each of us a desire to be right, think right, and act right.\n",
      "When we go against that desire, we put a cancer in our conscience. This\n",
      "cancer grows and grows by eating away at our confidence. Avoid doing\n",
      "anything that will cause you to ask yourself, “Will I get caught? Will they\n",
      "find out? Will I get away with it?”\n",
      "Don’t try to make an A if it means violating your confidence.\n",
      "Paul, I’m pleased to say, got the point. He learned the practical value of\n",
      "doing what’s right. I then proposed he sit down and retake the examination.\n",
      "In answer to his question “But what about my dismissal?” I said, “I know\n",
      "what the regulations say about cheating. But, you know, if we dismissed all\n",
      "students who have cheated in any way, half the professors would have to\n",
      "leave. And if we dismissed all students who thought about cheating, the\n",
      "university would have to shut down.\n",
      "“So I’m forgetting this whole incident if you’ll do me a favor.”\n",
      "“Gladly;” he said.\n",
      "I walked over to my bookshelf, took down my personal copy of Fifty\n",
      "Years with the Golden Rule, and said, “Paul, read this book and return it.\n",
      "See how, in J. C. Penney’s own words, just doing what’s right made him\n",
      "one of America’s richest men.”\n",
      "Doing what’s right keeps your conscience satisfied. And this builds self-\n",
      "confidence. When we do what is known to be wrong, two negative things\n",
      "happen. First, we feel guilt and this guilt eats away confidence. Second,\n",
      "other people sooner or later find out and lose confidence in us.\n",
      "Do what’s right and keep your confidence. That’s thinking yourself to\n",
      "success.\n",
      "Here is a psychological principle that is worth reading over twenty-five\n",
      "times. Read it until it absolutely saturates you: To think confidently, act\n",
      "confidently.\n",
      "The great psychologist Dr. George W. Crane said in his famous book\n",
      "Applied Psychology, “Remember, motions are the precursors of emotions.\n",
      "You can’t control the latter directly but only through your choice of motions\n",
      "or actions…. To avoid this all too common tragedy (marital difficulties and\n",
      "misunderstandings) become aware of the true psychological facts. Go\n",
      "through the proper motions each day and you’ll soon begin to feel the\n",
      "corresponding emotions! Just be sure you and your mate go through those\n",
      "motions of dates and kisses, the phrasing of sincere daily compliments, plus\n",
      "the many other little courtesies, and you need not worry about the emotion\n",
      "of love. You can’t act devoted for very long without feeling devoted.”\n",
      "Psychologists tell us we can change our attitudes by changing our\n",
      "physical actions. For example, you actually feel more like smiling if you\n",
      "make yourself smile. You feel more superior when you make yourself stand\n",
      "tall than when you slouch. On the negative side, frown a really bitter frown\n",
      "and see if you don’t feel more like frowning.\n",
      "It is easy to prove that managed motions can change emotions. People\n",
      "who are shy in introducing themselves can replace this timidity with\n",
      "confidence just by taking three simple actions simultaneously: First, reach\n",
      "for the other person’s hand and clasp it warmly. Second, look directly at the\n",
      "other person. And third, say, “I’m very glad to know you.”\n",
      "These three simple actions automatically and instantaneously banish\n",
      "shyness. Confident action produces confident thinking.\n",
      "So, to think confidently, act confidently. Act the way you want to feel.\n",
      "Below are five confidence-building exercises. Read these guides carefully.\n",
      "Then make a conscious effort to practice them and build your confidence.\n",
      "1. Be a front seater. Ever notice in meetings—in church, classrooms, and\n",
      "other kinds of assemblies—how the back seats fill up first? Most folks\n",
      "scramble to sit in the back rows so they won’t be “too conspicuous.” And\n",
      "the reason they are afraid to be conspicuous is that they lack confidence.\n",
      "Sitting up front builds confidence. Practice it. From now on make it a\n",
      "rule to sit as close to the front as you can. Sure, you may be a little more\n",
      "conspicuous in the front, but remember, there is nothing inconspicuous\n",
      "about success.\n",
      "2. Practice making eye contact. How a person uses his eyes tells us a lot\n",
      "about him. Instinctively, you ask yourself questions about the fellow who\n",
      "doesn’t look you in the eye. “What’s he trying to hide? What’s he afraid of?\n",
      "Is he trying to put something over on me? Is he holding something back?”\n",
      "Usually, failure to make eye contact says one of two things. It may say, “I\n",
      "feel weak beside you. I feel inferior to you. I’m afraid of you.” Or avoiding\n",
      "another person’s eyes may say, “I feel guilty. I’ve done something or I’ve\n",
      "thought something that I don’t want you to know. I’m afraid if I let my eyes\n",
      "connect with yours, you’ll see through me.”\n",
      "You say nothing good about yourself when you avoid making eye\n",
      "contact. You say, “I’m afraid. I lack confidence.” Conquer this fear by\n",
      "making yourself look the other person in the eyes.\n",
      "Looking the other person in the eye tells him, “I’m honest and\n",
      "aboveboard. I believe in what I’m telling you. I’m not afraid. I’m\n",
      "confident.”\n",
      "Make your eyes work for you. Aim them right at the other person’s eyes.\n",
      "It not only gives you confidence, it wins you confidence, too.\n",
      "3. Walk 25 percent faster. When I was a youngster, just going to the county\n",
      "seat was a big treat. After all the errands were accomplished and we were\n",
      "back in the car, my mother would often say, “Davey, let’s just sit here a\n",
      "while and watch the people walk by.” Mother was an excellent game\n",
      "player. She’d say, “See that fellow. What do you suppose is troubling\n",
      "him?” Or “What do you think that lady there is going to do?” or “Look at\n",
      "that person. He just seems to be in a fog.”\n",
      "Watching people walk and move about became real fun. It was a lot\n",
      "cheaper than the movies (which was one of the reasons, I learned later, that\n",
      "Mother developed the game), and it was a lot more instructive.\n",
      "I still am a walk watcher. In corridors, lobbies, on sidewalks I still\n",
      "occasionally find myself studying human behavior simply by watching\n",
      "people move about.\n",
      "Psychologists link slovenly posture and sluggish walking to unpleasant\n",
      "attitudes towards oneself, work, and the people around us. But\n",
      "psychologists also tell us you can actually change your attitudes by\n",
      "changing your posture and speed of movement. Watch, and you discover\n",
      "that body action is the result of mind action. The extremely beaten people,\n",
      "the real down-and-outers, just shuffle and stumble along. They have zero\n",
      "self-confidence.\n",
      "Average people have the “average” walk. Their pace is “average.” They\n",
      "have the look of “I really don’t have very much pride in myself.”\n",
      "Then there’s a third group. Persons in this group show superconfidence.\n",
      "They walk faster than the average. There seems to be a slight sprint in the\n",
      "way they walk. Their walk tells the world, “I’ve got someplace important to\n",
      "go, something important to do. What’s more, I will succeed at what I will\n",
      "do fifteen minutes from now.”\n",
      "Use the walk-25-percent-faster technique to help build self confidence.\n",
      "Throw your shoulders back, lift up your head, move ahead just a little\n",
      "faster, and feel self-confidence grow.\n",
      "Just try and see.\n",
      "4. Practice speaking up. In working with many kinds of groups of all sizes,\n",
      "I’ve watched many persons with keen perception and much native ability\n",
      "freeze and fail to participate in discussions. It isn’t that these folks don’t\n",
      "want to get in and wade with the rest. Rather, it’s a simple lack of\n",
      "confidence.\n",
      "The conference clam thinks to himself, “My opinion is probably\n",
      "worthless. If I say something, I’ll probably look foolish. I’ll just say\n",
      "nothing. Besides, the others in the group probably know more than I. I don’t\n",
      "want the others to know how ignorant I am.”\n",
      "Each time the conference clam fails to speak, he feels even more\n",
      "inadequate, more inferior. Often he makes a faint promise to himself (that\n",
      "down deep he knows he won’t keep) to speak “next time.”\n",
      "This is very important: each time our clam fails to speak, he takes one\n",
      "more dose of confidence poison. He becomes less and less confident of\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "But on the positive side, the more you speak up, the more you add to\n",
      "your confidence, and the easier it is to speak up the next time. Speak up. It’s\n",
      "a confidence-building vitamin.\n",
      "Put this confidence builder to use. Make it a rule to speak up at every\n",
      "open meeting you attend. Speak up, say something voluntarily at every\n",
      "business conference, committee meeting, community forum you attend.\n",
      "Make no exception. Comment, make a suggestion, ask a question. And\n",
      "don’t be the last to speak. Try to be the icebreaker, the first one in with a\n",
      "comment.\n",
      "And never worry about looking foolish. You won’t. For each person who\n",
      "doesn’t agree with you, odds are another person will. Quit asking yourself,\n",
      "“I wonder if I dare speak?” Instead, concentrate on getting the discussion\n",
      "leader’s attention so you can speak.\n",
      "For special training and experience in speaking, consider joining your\n",
      "local toastmaster’s club. Thousands of conscientious people have developed\n",
      "confidence through a planned program to feel at ease talking with people\n",
      "and to people.\n",
      "5. Smile big. Most folks have heard at one time or another that a smile will\n",
      "give them a real boost. They’ve been told that a smile is excellent\n",
      "medicine for confidence deficiency. But lots of people still don’t really\n",
      "believe this because they’ve never tried smiling when they feel fear.\n",
      "Make this little test. Try to feel defeated and smile big at the same time.\n",
      "You can’t. A big smile gives you confidence. A big smile beats fear, rolls\n",
      "away worry, defeats despondency.\n",
      "And a real smile does more than cure just your ill feeling. A real smile\n",
      "melts away the opposition of others—and instantly, too. Another person\n",
      "simply can’t be angry with you if you give him a big, sincere smile. Just the\n",
      "other day, a little incident happened to me that illustrates this. I was parked\n",
      "at an intersection waiting for the light to change when BAM! The driver\n",
      "behind me had let his foot slip the brake and put my rear bumper to a test. I\n",
      "looked back through my mirror and saw him getting out. I got out, too, and,\n",
      "forgetting the rule book, started preparing myself for verbal combat. I\n",
      "confess I was ready verbally to bite him to pieces.\n",
      "But fortunately, before I got the chance, he walked up to me, smiled, and\n",
      "said in the most earnest voice, “Friend, I really didn’t mean to do that.”\n",
      "That smile, matched with his sincere comment, melted me. I mumbled\n",
      "something about “That’s O.K. Happens all the time.” Almost in less time\n",
      "than it takes to wink an eye, my opposition turned into friendship.\n",
      "Smile big and you feel like “happy days are here again.” But smile big. A\n",
      "half-developed smile is not fully guaranteed. Smile until your teeth show.\n",
      "That large-size smile is fully guaranteed.\n",
      "I’ve heard many times, “Yes, but when I fear something, or when I’m\n",
      "angry, I don’t feel like smiling.”\n",
      "Of course you don’t. No one does. The trick is to tell yourself forcefully,\n",

      "HOW TO THINK BIG\n",
      "RECENTLY I CHATTED WITH a recruitment specialist for one of the nation’s largest\n",
      "industrial organizations. Four months each year she visits college campuses\n",
      "to recruit graduating seniors for her company’s junior executive training\n",
      "program. The tenor of her remarks indicated that she was discouraged about\n",
      "the attitudes of many people she talked with.\n",
      "“Most days I interview between eight and twelve college seniors, all in\n",
      "the upper third of their class, all at least mildly interested in coming with us.\n",
      "One of the main things we want to determine in the screening interview is\n",
      "the individual’s motivation. We want to find out if he or she is the kind of\n",
      "person who can, in a few years, direct major projects, manage a branch\n",
      "office or plant, or in some other way make a really substantial contribution\n",
      "to the company.\n",
      "“I must say I’m not too pleased with the personal objectives of most of\n",
      "those I talk with. You’d be surprised,” she went on, “how many twenty-two-\n",
      "year-olds are more interested in our retirement plan than in anything else we\n",
      "have to offer. A second favorite question is ‘Will I move around a lot?’\n",
      "Most of them seem to define the word success as synonymous with security.\n",
      "Can we risk turning our company over to people like that?\n",
      "“The thing I can’t understand is why should young people these days be\n",
      "so ultraconservative, so narrow in their view of the future? Every day there\n",
      "are more signs of expanding opportunity. This country is making record\n",
      "progress in scientific and industrial development. Our population is gaining\n",
      "rapidly. If there ever was a time to be bullish about America, it’s now.”\n",
      "The tendency for so many people to think small means there is much less\n",
      "competition than you think for a very rewarding career.\n",
      "Where success is concerned, people are not measured in inches or pounds\n",
      "or college degrees, or family background; they are measured by the size of\n",
      "their thinking. How big we think determines the size of our\n",
      "accomplishments. Now let’s see how we can enlarge our thinking.\n",
      "Ever ask yourself, “What is my greatest weakness?” Probably the\n",
      "greatest human weakness is self-deprecation—that is, selling oneself short.\n",
      "Self-deprecation shows through in countless ways. John sees a job\n",
      "advertisement in the paper; it’s exactly what he would like. But he does\n",
      "nothing about it because he thinks, “I’m not good enough for that job, so\n",
      "why bother?” Or Jim wants a date with Joan, but he doesn’t call her because\n",
      "he thinks he wouldn’t rate with her.\n",

      "Philosophers for thousands of years have issued good advice: Know\n",

      "Four Ways to Develop the Big Thinker’s\n",
      "Vocabulary\n",
      "Here are four ways to help you develop a big thinker’s vocabulary.\n",
      "1. Use big, positive, cheerful words and phrases to describe how you feel.\n",
      "When someone asks, “How do you feel today?” and you respond with an\n",
      "“I’m tired (I have a headache, I wish it were Saturday, I don’t feel so\n",
      "good),” you actually make yourself feel worse. Practice this: it’s a very\n",
      "simple point, but it has tremendous power. Every time someone asks you,\n",
      "“How are you?” or “How are you feeling today?” respond with a “Just\n",
      "wonderful thanks, and you?” or say “Great” or “Fine.” Say you feel\n",
      "wonderful at every possible opportunity, and you will begin to feel\n",
      "wonderful—and bigger, too. Become known as a person who always\n",
      "feels great. It wins friends.\n",
      "2. Use bright, cheerful, favorable words and phrases to describe other\n",
      "people. Make it a rule to have a big, positive word for all your friends\n",
      "and associates. When you and someone else are discussing an absent\n",
      "third party, be sure you compliment him with big words and phrases like\n",
      "“He’s really a fine fellow.” “They tell me he’s working out wonderfully\n",
      "well.” Be extremely careful to avoid the petty cut-him-down language.\n",
      "Sooner or later third parties hear what’s been said, and then such talk\n",
      "only cuts you down.\n",
      "3. Use positive language to encourage others. Compliment people\n",
      "personally at every opportunity, Everyone you know craves praise. Have\n",
      "a special good word for your wife or husband every day. Notice and\n",
      "compliment the people who work with you. Praise, sincerely\n",
      "administered, is a success tool. Use it! Use it again and again and again.\n",
      "Compliment people on their appearance, their work, their achievements,\n",
      "their families.\n",
      "4. Use positive words to outline plans to others. When people hear\n",
      "something like this: “Here is some good news. We face a genuine\n",
      "opportunity …” their minds start to sparkle. But when they hear\n",
      "something like “Whether we like it or not, we’ve got a job to do,” the\n",
      "mind movie is dull and boring, and they react accordingly. Promise\n",
      "victory and watch eyes light up. Promise victory and win support. Build\n",
      "castles, don’t dig graves!\n",
      "SEE WHAT CAN BE, NOT JUST WHAT\n",
      "IS\n",
      "Big thinkers train themselves to see not just what is but what can be. Here\n",
      "are four examples to illustrate this point.\n",
      "1. What gives real estate value? A highly successful Realtor who\n",
      "specializes in rural property shows what can be done if we train\n",
      "ourselves to see something where little or nothing presently exists.\n",
      "“Most of the rural property around here,” my friend began, “is run-down\n",
      "and not very attractive. I’m successful because I don’t try to sell my\n",
      "prospects a farm as it is.\n",
      "“I develop my entire sales plan around what the farm can be. Simply\n",
      "telling the prospect, ‘The farm has XX acres of bottom land and XX acres\n",
      "of woods and is XX miles from town,’ doesn’t stir him up and make him\n",
      "want to buy it. But when you show him a concrete plan for doing something\n",
      "with the farm, he’s just about sold. Here, let me show you what I mean.”\n",
      "He opened his briefcase and pulled out a file. “This farm,” he said, “is a\n",
      "new listing with us. It’s like a lot of them. It’s forty-three miles from the\n",
      "center of the metropolitan area, the house is run-down, and the place hasn’t\n",
      "been farmed in five years. Now, here’s what I’ve done. I spent two full days\n",
      "on the place last week, just studying it. I walked over the place several\n",
      "times. I looked at neighboring farms. I studied the location of the farm with\n",
      "respect to existing and planned highways. I asked myself, ‘What’s this farm\n",
      "good for?’\n",
      "“I came up with three possibilities. Here they are.” He showed them to\n",
      "me. Each plan was neatly typed and looked quite comprehensive. One plan\n",
      "suggested converting the farm into a riding stable. The plan showed why\n",
      "the idea was sound: a growing city, more love for the outdoors, more money\n",
      "for recreation, good roads. The plan also showed how the farm could\n",
      "support a sizable number of horses so that the revenue from the rides would\n",
      "be largely clear. The whole riding stable idea was very thorough, very\n",
      "convincing. The plan was so clear and convincing, I could “see” a dozen\n",
      "couples riding horseback through the trees.\n",
      "In similar fashion this enterprising salesman developed a second\n",
      "thorough plan for a tree farm and a third plan for a combination tree and\n",
      "poultry farm.\n",
      "“Now when I talk with my prospects, I won’t have to convince them that\n",
      "the farm is a good buy as it is. I help them to see a picture of the farm\n",
      "changed into a moneymaking proposition. Besides selling more farms and\n",
      "selling them faster, I can sell a farm at a higher price than my competitors.\n",
      "People naturally pay more for acreage and an idea than they do for just\n",
      "acreage. Because of this, more people want to list their farms with me and\n",
      "my commission on each sale is larger.”\n",
      "The moral is this: Look at things not as they are, but as they can be.\n",
      "Visualization adds value to everything. A big thinker always visualizes what\n",
      "can be done in the future. He isn’t stuck with the present.\n",
      "2. How much is a customer worth? A department store executive was\n",
      "addressing a conference of merchandise managers. She was saying, “I\n",
      "may be a little old-fashioned, but I belong to the school that believes the\n",
      "best way to get customers to come back is to give them friendly,\n",
      "courteous service. One day I was walking through our store when I\n",
      "overheard a salesperson arguing with a customer. The customer left in\n",
      "quite a huff.\n",

      "customer take up all my time and make me take the store apart trying to\n",
      "find him what he wants. He’s simply not worth it.’\n",
      "“I walked away,” the executive continued, “but I couldn’t get that remark\n",
      "out of my mind. It is pretty serious, I thought, when our salespeople think of\n",
      "customers as being in the $1.98 category. I decided right then that this\n",
      "concept must be changed. When I got back to my office, I called our\n",
      "research director and asked him to find out how much the average customer\n",
      "spent in our store last year. The figure he came up with surprised even me.\n",
      "According to our research director’s careful calculation, the typical\n",
      "customer spent $362 in our establishment.\n",
      "“The next thing I did was call a meeting of all supervisory personnel and\n",
      "explain the incident to them. Then I showed them what a customer is really\n",
      "worth. Once I got these people to see that a customer is not to be valued on\n",
      "a single sale but rather on an annual basis, customer service definitely\n",
      "improved.”\n",
      "The point made by the retailing executive applies to any kind of business.\n",
      "It’s repeat business that makes the profit. Often, there’s no profit at all on\n",
      "the first several sales. Look at the potential expenditures of the customers,\n",
      "not just what they buy today.\n",
      "Putting a big value on customers is what converts them into big, regular\n",
      "patrons. Attaching little value to customers sends them elsewhere. A\n",
      "student related this pertinent incident to me, explaining why he’ll never\n",
      "again eat in a certain cafeteria.\n",
      "“For lunch one day,” the student began, “I decided to try a new cafeteria\n",
      "that had just opened a couple of weeks before. Nickels and dimes are pretty\n",
      "important to me right now, so I watch what I buy pretty closely. Walking\n",

      "good, and it was plainly marked 39 cents.\n",

      "‘1.09.’ I politely asked her to check it again because my tally was 99 cents.\n",
      "After giving me a mean glare, she recounted. The difference turned out to\n",
      "be the turkey. She had charged me 49 cents instead of 39 cents. Then I\n",
      "called her attention to the sign, which read 39 cents.\n",
      "“This really set her off! ‘I don’t care what that sign says. It’s supposed to\n",
      "be 49 cents. See. Here’s my price list for today. Somebody back there made\n",
      "a mistake. You’ll have to pay the 49 cents.’\n",
      "“Then I tried to explain to her the only reason I selected the turkey was\n",
      "because it was 39 cents. If it had been marked 49 cents I’d have taken\n",
      "something else.\n",
      "“To this, her answer was ‘You’ll just have to pay the 49 cents.’ I did,\n",
      "because I didn’t want to stand there and create a scene. But I decided on the\n",
      "spot that I’d never eat there again. I spend about $250 a year for lunches,\n",
      "and you can be sure they’ll not get one penny of it.”\n",
      "There’s an example of the little view. The checker saw one thin dime, not\n",
      "the potential $250.\n",
      "3. The case of the blind milkman. It’s surprising how people sometimes are\n",
      "blind to potential. A few years ago a young milkman came to our door to\n",
      "solicit our dairy business. I explained to him that we already had milk\n",

      "To this he replied, “I’ve already talked to the lady next door, but they use\n",

      "worthwhile for me to stop.”\n",
      "“That may be, I said, “but when you talked to our neighbor, did you not\n",
      "observe that the demand for milk in that household will increase\n",
      "considerably in a month or so? There will be a new addition over there that\n",
      "will consume lots of milk.”\n",
      "The young man looked for a moment like he had been struck, and then he\n",
      "said, “How blind can a guy be?”\n",
      "Today that same one-quart-every-two-days family buys seven quarts\n",
      "every two days from a milkman who had some foresight. That first\n",
      "youngster, a boy, now has two brothers and one sister. And I’m told there’ll\n",

      "it be a vacant lot, a house, or a business—has value in proportion to the\n",
      "ideas for using it.\n",
      "2. Practice adding value to people. As you move higher and higher in the\n",

      "how he could help other employees, he jumped right in.\n",
      "“The first year Harry was with me we lost a few men. Harry came to me\n",
      "with a fringe benefit program which he promised would cut down turnover\n",
      "at low cost. And it worked.\n",
      "“Harry did many other things, too, which helped the whole company, not\n",
      "just this department. He made a detailed cost study of our production\n",
      "department and showed me how a $30,000 investment in new machinery\n",
      "would pay off. Once we experienced a pretty bad sales slump. Harry went\n",
      "to our sales manager and said, in effect, ‘I don’t know much about the sales\n",
      "end of the business, but let me try to help.’ And he did. Harry came up with\n",
      "several good ideas which helped us sell more jobs.\n",
      "“When a new employee joined us, Harry was right there to help the\n",
      "fellow get comfortable. Harry took a real interest in the entire operation.\n",
      "“When I retired, Harry was the only logical person to take over.\n",
      "“But don’t misunderstand,” my friend continued, “Harry didn’t try to put\n",
      "himself over on me. He wasn’t a mere meddler. He wasn’t aggressive in a\n",
      "negative way. He didn’t stab people in the back, and he didn’t go around\n",
      "giving orders. He just went around helping. Harry simply acted as if\n",
      "everything in the company affected him. He made company business his\n",
      "business.”\n",
      "We can all learn a lesson from Harry. The “I‘m doing my job and that’s\n",
      "enough” attitude is small, negative thinking. Big thinkers see themselves as\n",
      "members of a team effort, as winning or losing with the team, not by\n",
      "themselves. They help in every way they can, even when there is no direct\n",
      "and immediate compensation or other reward. The fellow who shrugs off a\n",
      "problem outside his own department with the comment “Well, that’s no\n",
      "concern of mine, let them worry with it” hasn’t got the attitude it takes for\n",
      "top leadership.\n",
      "Practice this. Practice being a big thinker. See the company’s interest as\n",
      "identical with your own. Probably only a very few persons working in large\n",
      "companies have a sincere, unselfish interest in their company. But after all,\n",
      "only a relatively few persons qualify as big thinkers. And these few are the\n",
      "ones eventually rewarded with the most responsible, best-paying jobs.\n",
      "Many, many potentially powerful people let petty, small, insignificant\n",
      "things block their way to achievement. Let’s look at four examples.\n",
      "1. What Does It Take To Make a Good Speech?\n",
      "Just about everyone wishes he had the “ability” to do a first-class job of\n",
      "speaking in public. But most people don’t get their wish. Most folks are\n",
      "lousy public speakers.\n",
      "Why? The reason is simple: most people concentrate on the small, trivial\n",
      "things of speaking at the expense of the big, important things. In preparing\n",
      "to give a talk, most people give themselves a host of mental instructions,\n",
      "like “I’ve got to remember to stand straight,” “Don’t move around and\n",
      "don’t use your hands,” “Don’t let the audience see you use your notes,”\n",
      "“Remember, don’t make mistakes in grammar, especially don’t say ‘for he\n",
      "and I,’ say ‘for him and me,’” “Be sure your tie is straight,” “Speak loud,\n",
      "but not too loud,” and so on and on.\n",
      "Now, what happens when the speaker gets up to speak? He’s scared\n",
      "because he’s given himself a terrific list of things not to do. He gets\n",
      "confused in his talk and finds himself silently asking, “Have I made a\n",
      "mistake?” He is, in brief, a flop. He’s a flop because he concentrated on the\n",
      "petty, trivial, relatively unimportant qualities of a good speaker and failed to\n",
      "concentrate on the big things that make a good speaker: knowledge of what\n",
      "he’s going to talk about and an intense desire to tell it to other people.\n",
      "The real test of a speaker is not did he stand straight or did he make any\n",
      "mistakes in grammar, but rather did the audience get the points he wanted to\n",
      "put across. Most of our top speakers have petty defects; some of them even\n",
      "have unpleasant voices. Some of the most sought-after speakers in America\n",
      "would flunk a speech course taught by the old negative, “don’t do this and\n",
      "don’t do that,” method.\n",
      "Yet all these successful public speakers have one thing in common: They\n",
      "have something to say and they feel a burning desire for other people to\n",
      "hear it.\n",
      "Don’t let concern with trivia keep you from speaking successfully in\n",
      "public.\n",
      "2. What Causes Quarrels?\n",
      "Ever stop to ask yourself just what causes quarrels? At least 99 percent of\n",
      "the time, quarrels start over petty, unimportant matters like this: John comes\n",
      "home a little tired, a little on edge. Dinner doesn’t exactly please him, so he\n",
      "turns up his nose and complains. Joan’s day wasn’t perfect either, so she\n",
      "rallies to her own defense with “Well, what do you expect on my food\n",
      "budget?” or “Maybe I could cook better if I had a new stove like everybody\n",
      "else.” This insults John’s pride, so he attacks with “Now, Joan, it’s not lack\n",
      "of money; it’s simply that you don’t know how to manage.”\n",
      "And away they go! Before a truce is finally declared, all sorts of\n",
      "accusations are made by each party. In-laws, sex, money, premarital and\n",
      "postmarital promises, and other issues will be introduced. Both parties leave\n",
      "the battle nervous, tense. Nothing has been settled, and both parties have\n",
      "new ammunition to make the next quarrel more vicious. Little things, petty\n",
      "thinking, causes arguments. So, to eliminate quarrels, eliminate petty\n",
      "thinking.\n",
      "Here’s a technique that works: before complaining or accusing or\n",
      "reprimanding someone or launching a counterattack in self-defense, ask\n",
      "yourself, “Is it really important?” In most cases, it isn’t and you avoid\n",
      "conflict.\n",
      "Ask yourself, “Is it really important if he (or she) is messy with cigarettes\n",
      "or forgets to put the cap on the toothpaste or is late coming home?”\n",
      "“Is it really important if he (or she) squandered a little money or invited\n",
      "some people in I don’t like?”\n",
      "When you feel like taking negative action, ask yourself, “Is it really\n",
      "important?” That question works magic in building a finer home situation.\n",
      "It works at the office, too. It works in home-going traffic when another\n",
      "driver cuts in ahead of you. It works in any situation in life that is apt to\n",
      "produce quarrels.\n",
      "3. John Got the Smallest Office and Fizzled Out\n",
      "Several years ago, I observed small thinking about an office assignment\n",
      "destroy a young fellow’s chances for a profitable career in advertising.\n",
      "Four young executives, all on the same status level, were moved into new\n",
      "offices. Three of the offices were identical in size and decoration. The\n",
      "fourth was smaller and less elaborate.\n",
      "J. M. was assigned the fourth office. This turned out to be a real blow to\n",
      "his pride. Immediately he felt discriminated against. Negative thinking,\n",
      "resentment, bitterness, jealousy built up. J. M. began to feel inadequate. The\n",
      "result was that J. M. grew hostile toward his fellow executives. Rather than\n",
      "cooperate, he did his best to undermine their efforts. Things got worse.\n",
      "Three months later J. M. slipped so badly that management had no choice\n",
      "but to issue him a pink slip.\n",
      "Small thinking over a very small matter stopped J. M. in his haste to feel\n",
      "he was discriminated against, J. M. failed to observe that the company was\n",
      "expanding rapidly and office space was at a premium. He didn’t stop to\n",
      "consider the possibility that the executive who made the office assignments\n",
      "didn’t even know which one was the smallest! No one in the organization,\n",
      "except J. M., regarded his office as an index of his value.\n",
      "Small thinking about unimportant things like seeing your name last on\n",
      "the department route sheet or getting late notice of an office memo can hurt\n",
      "you. Think big, and none of these little things can hold you back.\n",
      "4. Even Stuttering Is a Detail\n",
      "A sales executive told me how even stuttering is a mere detail in\n",
      "salesmanship if the fellow has the really important qualities.\n",
      "“I have a friend, also a sales executive, who loves to play practical jokes,\n",
      "though sometimes these jokes aren’t jokes at all. A few months ago a young\n",
      "fellow called on my practical-joking friend and asked for a sales job. The\n",
      "fellow had a terrible speech impediment, though, and my friend decided\n",
      "right here was a chance to play a joke on me. So the friend told the\n",
      "applicant that he wasn’t in the market for a salesman right now but one of\n",
      "his friends (me) had a spot to fill. Then he phoned me, and, boy, did he give\n",
      "this fellow a buildup. I said, ‘Send him right over!’\n",
      "“Thirty minutes later, in he walked. The young fellow hadn’t said three\n",
      "words before I knew why my friend was so eager to send him over. Almost\n",
      "every word was a struggle. I thought to myself, ‘This guy couldn’t sell a\n",
      "dollar bill for 90 cents on Wall Street.’ I was sore at my friend, but I really\n",
      "felt sorry for this fellow, so I thought the least I could do was to ask him\n",
      "some polite questions while I thought up a good excuse as to why I couldn’t\n",
      "use him.\n",
      "“As we talked on, however, I discovered this fellow was no stupe. He\n",
      "was intelligent. He handled himself very nicely, but I just couldn’t overlook\n",
      "the fact that he had a severe speech impediment. Finally, I decided I’d wind\n",
      "up the interview by asking one last question. ‘What makes you think you\n",
      "can sell?’\n",
      "“‘Well,’ he said, ‘I learn fast, I like people, I think you’ve got a good\n",
      "company; and I want to make money, Now, I do have a speech impairment,\n",
      "but that doesn’t bother me, so why should it bother anybody else?’\n",
      "“His answer showed me he had all the really important qualifications for\n",
      "a salesman. I decided right then to give him a chance. And you know, he’s\n",
      "working out very well.”\n",
      "Even a speech impairment in a talker’s profession is a triviality if the\n",
      "person has the big qualities.\n",
      "Practice these three procedures to help yourself think about trivialities:\n",
      "1. Keep your eyes focused on the big objective. Many times we’re like the\n",
      "salesman who, failing to make the sale, reports to his manager, “Yes, but\n",
      "I sure convinced the customer he was wrong.” In selling, the big\n",
      "objective is winning sales, not arguments.\n",
      "In marriage the big objective is peace, happiness, tranquillity—not\n",
      "winning quarrels or saying “I could have told you so.”\n",
      "In working with employees, the big objective is developing their full\n",
      "potential, not making issues out of their minor errors.\n",
      "In living with neighbors, the big objective is mutual respect and\n",
      "friendship—not seeing if you can have their dog impounded because\n",
      "once in a while it barks at night.\n",
      "Paraphrasing some military lingo, it is much better to lose a battle and\n",
      "win the war than to win a battle and lose the war.\n",
      "Resolve to keep your eyes on the big ball.\n",
      "2. Ask “Is it really important?” Before becoming negatively excited, just\n",
      "ask yourself, “Is it important enough for me to get all worked up about?”\n",
      "There is no better way to avoid frustration over petty matters than to use\n",
      "this medicine. At least 90 percent of quarrels and feuds would never take\n",
      "place if we just faced troublesome situations with “Is this really\n",
      "important?”\n",
      "3. Don’t fall into the triviality trap. In making speeches, solving problems,\n",
      "counseling employees, think of those things that really matter, things that\n",
      "make the difference. Don’t become submerged under surface issues.\n",

      "some illogical reason, science, engineering, art, and writing got tabbed as\n",
      "about the only truly creative pursuits. Most people associate creative\n",
      "thinking with things like the discovery of electricity or polio vaccine, or the\n",
      "writing of a novel or the development of color television.\n",
      "Certainly, accomplishments like these are evidence of creative thinking.\n",
      "Each forward step made in the conquest of space is the result of creative\n",
      "thinking, lots of it. But creative thinking is not reserved for certain\n",
      "occupations, nor is it restricted to superintelligent people.\n",
      "Well, then, what is creative thinking?\n",
      "A low-income family devises a plan to send their son to a leading\n",
      "university. That’s creative thinking.\n",
      "A family turns the street’s most undesirable lot into the neighborhood\n",
      "beauty spot. That’s creative thinking.\n",
      "A minister develops a plan that doubles his Sunday evening attendance.\n",
      "That’s creative thinking.\n",
      "Figuring out ways to simplify record keeping, selling to the “impossible”\n",
      "customer, keeping the children occupied constructively, making employees\n",
      "really like their work, or preventing a “certain” quarrel—all of these are\n",
      "examples of practical, everyday creative thinking.\n",
      "Creative thinking is simply finding new, improved ways to do anything.\n",
      "The rewards of all types of success—success in the home, at work, in the\n",
      "community—hinge on finding ways to do things better. Now let’s see what\n",
      "we can do to develop and strengthen our creative thinking ability.\n",
      "Step one: Believe it can be done. Here is a basic truth: To do anything,\n",
      "we must first believe it can be done. Believing something can be done sets\n",
      "the mind in motion to find a way to do it.\n",
      "To illustrate this point of creative thinking in training sessions, I often use\n",
      "this example: I ask the group, “How many of you feel it is possible to\n",
      "eliminate jails within the next thirty years?”\n",
      "Invariably the group looks bewildered, not quite sure they heard right and\n",
      "thinking they are listening to a real oddball. So after a pause I repeat, “How\n",

      "“Did you read in this morning’s paper about that murder?”\n",

      "for jails. Will you do me a favor? Will you try extra hard for a few minutes\n",

      "Joining in the spirit of the experiment, the group says, in effect, “Oh,\n",
      "well, but just for kicks.” Then I ask, “Now, assuming we can eliminate jails,\n",

      "suggestion? approach. Don’t be dogmatic. Don’t announce a fresh idea as\n",

      "first. See how your associates react to it. If you do, chances are you’ll\n",

      "3. Concentrate on what the other person says. Listening is more than just\n",
      "keeping your own mouth shut. Listening means letting what’s said\n",

      "about the idea of someday owning a five-acre estate. Everyone I talked to\n",
      "said, in effect, ‘I’d love that.’\n",
      "“I continued to think about it and to figure how I could turn the idea into\n",
      "profit. Then one day as I was driving to work the answer came out of\n",
      "nowhere. Why not buy a farm and divide it into estates? I figured the land\n",
      "might be worth more in relatively small pieces than in one big piece.\n",
      "“Twenty-two miles from the center of the city, I found a worn-out fifty-\n",
      "acre farm priced at $8,500. I bought it, paying only one-third down and\n",

      "would be covered with beautiful pine trees.\n",
      "“Then I got a surveyor to divide the fifty acres into ten five-acre plots.\n",
      "“Now I was ready to start selling. I got several mailing lists of young\n",
      "executives in the city and put on a small-scale direct-mail campaign. I\n",
      "pointed out how, for only $3,000, the price of a small city lot, they could\n",

      "with a group completely foreign to my occupational interests, my brain\n",
      "would have never worked out this successful plan for making a profit.”\n",
      "There are many ways to get mental stimulation, but here are two that you\n",
      "can incorporate into your pattern of life.\n",
      "First, join and meet regularly with at least one professional group that\n",
      "provides stimulation in your own occupational area. Rub shoulders—and\n",
      "minds—with other success-oriented people.\n",
      "So often I hear someone say, “I picked up a great idea this afternoon at\n",
      "the——meeting” or “During the meeting yesterday I got to thinking…”\n",
      "Remember, a mind that feeds only on itself soon is undernourished,\n",
      "becoming weak and incapable of creative progressive thought. Stimulation\n",
      "from others is excellent mind food.\n",
      "Second, join and participate in at least one group outside your\n",
      "occupational interests. Association with people who have different job\n",
      "interests broadens your thinking and helps you to see the big picture. You’ll\n",
      "be surprised how mixing regularly with people outside your occupational\n",
      "area will stimulate your on-the-job thinking.\n",
      "Ideas are fruits of your thinking. But they’ve got to be harnessed and put\n",
      "to work to have value.\n",
      "Each year an oak tree produces enough acorns to populate a good-sized\n",
      "forest. Yet from these bushels of seeds perhaps only one or two acorns will\n",
      "become a tree. The squirrels destroy most of them, and the hard ground\n",
      "beneath the tree doesn’t give the few remaining seeds much chance for a\n",
      "start.\n",
      "So it is with ideas. Very few bear fruit. Ideas are highly perishable. If\n",
      "we’re not on guard, the squirrels (negative-thinking people) will destroy\n",
      "most of them. Ideas require special handling from the time they are born\n",
      "until they’re transformed into practical ways for doing things better. Use\n",
      "these three ways to harness and develop your ideas:\n",
      "1. Don’t let ideas escape. Write them down. Every day lots of good ideas\n",
      "are born only to die quickly because they aren’t nailed to paper. Memory is\n",
      "a weak slave when it comes to preserving and nurturing brand-new ideas.\n",
      "Carry a note book or some small cards with you. When you get an idea,\n",
      "write it down. A friend who travels a lot keeps a clipboard beside him so\n",
      "that he can write down an idea the instant it occurs to him. People with\n",
      "fertile, creative minds know a good idea may sprout any time, any place.\n",
      "Don’t let ideas escape; else you destroy the fruits of your thinking. Fence\n",
      "them in.\n",
      "2. Next, review your ideas. File these ideas in an active file. The file can\n",
      "be an elaborate cabinet, or it can be a desk drawer, A shoe box will do. But\n",
      "build a file and then examine your storehouse of ideas regularly. As you go\n",
      "over your ideas, some may, for very good reasons, have no value at all. Get\n",
      "rid of them. But so long as the idea has any promise, keep it.\n",
      "3. Cultivate and fertilize your idea. Now make your idea grow. Think\n",
      "about it. Tie the idea to related ideas. Read anything you can find that is in\n",
      "any way akin to your idea. Investigate all angles. Then, when the time is\n",
      "ripe, put it to work for yourself, your job, your future.\n",
      "When an architect gets an idea for a new building, she makes a\n",
      "preliminary drawing. When a creative advertising person gets an idea for a\n",
      "new TV commercial, he puts it into storyboard form, a series of drawings\n",
      "that suggest what the idea will look like in finished form. Writers with ideas\n",
      "prepare a first draft.\n",
      "Note: Shape up the idea on paper. There are two excellent reasons for\n",
      "this. When the idea takes tangible form, you can literally look at it, see the\n",
      "loopholes, see what it needs in the way of polish. Then, too, ideas have to\n",
      "be “sold” to someone: customers, employees, the boss, friends, fellow club\n",
      "members, investors. Somebody must “buy” the idea; else it has no value.\n",
      "One summer I was contacted by two life insurance salesmen. Both\n",
      "wanted to work on my insurance program. Both promised to return with a\n",
      "plan for making the needed changes. The first salesman gave me strictly an\n",
      "oral presentation. He told me in words what I needed. But I soon was\n",
      "confused. He brought in taxes, options, Social Security, all the technical\n",
      "details of insurance programming. Frankly, he lost me and I had to say no.\n",
      "The second salesman used a different approach. He had charted his\n",
      "recommendations. All the details were shown in diagram form. I could\n",
      "grasp his proposal easily and quickly because I could literally see it. He\n",
      "sold me.\n",
      "Resolve to put your ideas in saleable form. An idea written or in some\n",
      "sort of picture or diagram form has many times more selling power than the\n",
      "idea presented only in oral form.\n",
      "USE THESE TOOLS AND THINK\n",
      "CREATIVELY\n",
      "Believe it can be done. When you believe something can be done, your\n",

      "quality of your output), and: Do more of what you do (increase the quantity\n",
      "of your output).\n",
      "Practice asking and listening. Ask and listen, and you’ll obtain raw material\n",
      "for reaching sound decisions. Remember: Big people monopolize the\n",

      "classic, so let’s go over it again.\n",
      "When asked, “What are you doing?” the first bricklayer replied, “Laying\n",
      "brick.” The second answered, “Making $9.30 an hour.” And the third said,\n",
      "“Me? Why, I’m building the world’s greatest cathedral.”\n",
      "Now, the story doesn’t tell us what happened to these bricklayers in later\n",
      "years, but what do you think happened? Chances are that the first two\n",
      "bricklayers remained just that: bricklayers. They lacked vision. They lacked\n",
      "job respect. There was nothing behind them to propel them forward to\n",
      "greater success.\n",
      "But you can wager every cent you have the bricklayer who visualized\n",
      "himself as building a great cathedral did not remain a bricklayer. Perhaps he\n",
      "became a foreman, or perhaps a contractor, or possibly an architect. He\n",
      "moved forward and upward. Why? Because thinking does make it so.\n",
      "Bricklayer number three was tuned to thought channels that pointed the way\n",
      "to self-development in his work.\n",
      "Job thinking tells a lot about a person and his potential for larger\n",
      "responsibility.\n",
      "A friend who operates a personnel selection firm said this to me recently:\n",
      "“One thing we always look for in appraising a job applicant for a client is\n",
      "how the applicant thinks about his present job. We are always favorably\n",
      "impressed when we find that an applicant thinks his present job is\n",
      "important, even though there may be something about it he doesn’t like.\n",
      "“Why? Simply this: If the applicant feels his present job is important,\n",
      "odds are that he will take pride in his next job, too. We’ve found an\n",
      "amazingly close correlation between a person’s job respect and his job\n",
      "performance.”\n",
      "Like your appearance, the way you think toward your work says things\n",

      "A few months ago I spent several hours with a friend who is personnel\n",
      "director for an appliance manufacturer. We talked about “building men.” He\n",
      "explained his “personnel audit system” and what he had learned from it.\n",
      "“We have about eight hundred nonproduction people,” he began. “Under\n",
      "our personnel audit system, an assistant and I interview each employee\n",
      "every six months. Our purpose is simple. We want to learn how we can help\n",
      "him in his job. We think this is a good practice because each person\n",
      "working with us is important, else he wouldn’t be on the payroll.\n",
      "“We are careful not to ask the employees any pointblank questions.\n",
      "Instead we encourage him to talk about whatever he wants to. We aim to get\n",
      "his honest impressions. After each interview we fill out a rating form on the\n",
      "employee’s attitudes toward specific aspects of his job.\n",
      "“Now, here’s something I’ve learned,” he went on. “Our employees fit\n",
      "into one of two categories, group A and group B, on the basis of how they\n",
      "think toward their jobs.\n",
      "“The persons in group B talk mainly about security, company retirement\n",

      "insurance program, and if they will be asked to work overtime next March\n",
      "as they were last March. They also talk a lot about disagreeable features of\n",
      "their job, things they don’t like in fellow workers, and so on. People in\n",

      "except a chance. The group A people think on a broader scale. They make\n",
      "suggestions for improving the business. They regard these interviews in my\n",
      "office as constructive. But the group B people often feel our personnel audit\n",
      "system is just a brainwashing affair, and they’re glad to get it over with.\n",
      "“Now, there’s a way I check attitudes and what they mean to job success.\n",
      "All recommendations for promotions, pay increases, and special privileges\n",
      "are channeled to me by the employee’s immediate supervisor. Almost\n",
      "invariably, it’s a group A person who was recommended. And again almost\n",
      "without exception, problems come from the group B category.\n",
      "“The biggest challenge in my job,” he said, “is to try and help people\n",

      "more, of course.\n",
      "Another way to note the power of imitation is to observe the attitudes of\n",

      "afraid, and I know my voice sounded that way on the phone. It was easy for\n",

      "than on any other day. But the trouble was that little of Monday’s\n",
      "inspiration carried over to Tuesday and the rest of the week.\n",
      "“Then I got an idea. If the sales manager can pep me up, why can’t I pep\n",
      "myself up? Why not give myself a pep talk just before I start making those\n",
      "phone calls? That day I decided to try it. Without telling anyone I walked\n",
      "out on the lot and found a vacant car. Then for several minutes I talked to\n",
      "myself. I told myself, I’m a good car salesman and I’m going to be the best.\n",
      "I sell good cars and I give good deals. The people I’m phoning need those\n",

      "notch salesman and I’m going to get results, and I do.”\n",
      "That’s a pretty good idea, isn’t it? To be on top, you’ve got to feel like\n",

      "Recently, in a training program I conducted, each person was asked to\n",

      "miserable presentation. His knees literally shook and his hands trembled.\n",
      "He forgot what he was going to say. After fumbling for five or six minutes,\n",
      "he sat down, thoroughly defeated.\n",
      "After the session, I spoke to him just long enough to ask him to be there\n",
      "fifteen minutes early at the next session.\n",
      "As promised, he was there fifteen minutes ahead of time for the next\n",
      "session. The two of us sat down to discuss his talk of the night before. I\n",

      "about the five minutes just before he gave his talk.\n",
      "“Well, I guess all I thought about was how scared I was. I knew I was\n",
      "going to make a fool of myself. I knew I was going to be a flop. I kept\n",

      "“Right there,” I interjected, “is the answer to your problem. Before you\n",
      "got up to talk you gave yourself a terrible mental beating. You convinced\n",
      "yourself that you would fail. Is it any wonder your talk didn’t come off\n",
      "well? Instead of developing courage, you developed fear.\n",
      "“Now, this evening’s session,” I continued, “starts in just four minutes.\n",
      "Here’s what I’d like you to do. Give yourself a pep talk for the next few\n",

      "to give a great talk. I’ve got something those people need to hear and I want\n",

      "1. Dig into it deeper. Make this little test. Think of two things in which you\n",

      "modern art explain it to me. Really, now that I’ve dug into it, I find it\n",
      "fascinating.\n",
      "That exercise supplies one important key for building enthusiasm: To get\n",
      "enthusiastic, learn more about the thing you are not enthusiastic about.\n",
      "Chances are you are quite unenthusiastic about bumblebees. But if you\n",
      "study bumblebees, find out what good they do, how they relate to other\n",

      "can about bumblebees, you will soon find yourself really interested in\n",
      "bumblebees.\n",
      "To show trainees how enthusiasm can be developed through the dig-into-\n",
      "it-deeper technique, I sometimes use a greenhouse example. In a\n",
      "deliberately casual way I ask the group, “Are any of you interested in\n",
      "manufacturing and selling greenhouses?” Not once have I gotten an\n",
      "affirmative answer. Then I make a few points about greenhouses: I remind\n",

      "more interested in non-necessities. I suggest how much Mr. Jones would\n",
      "enjoy growing his own orchids and orange blossoms. I point out that if tens\n",

      "afford greenhouses because greenhouses are relatively inexpensive. I show\n",
      "them that if you could sell a $600 greenhouse to only one family in fifty,\n",
      "you’d develop a $600 million business in producing greenhouses, and\n",
      "perhaps a $250 million industry supplying plants and seeds.\n",

      "away from the curb when a wildly waving, shouting, and running would-be\n",
      "passenger was just a second or two from the door. Over a period of several\n",
      "months I saw this driver show special courtesy to only one passenger, and\n",
      "this passenger was shown special courtesy many times. The driver would\n",
      "wait for this passenger.\n",
      "And why? Because this passenger went out of his way to make the driver\n",
      "feel important. Every morning he greeted the driver with a personalized,\n",
      "sincere “Good morning, sir.” Sometimes this passenger would sit near the\n",
      "driver and make little comments like “You sure have a lot of\n",
      "responsibility”; “It must take nerves of steel to drive through traffic like this\n",
      "every day”; “You sure keep this thing on schedule.” That passenger made\n",
      "the driver feel as important as if he were piloting a 180-passenger jet\n",

      "It pays to make “little” people feel like big people.\n",
      "Today, in thousands of offices all over America, secretaries are helping\n",

      "about people, he gets their best out of them.\n",
      "Here’s the second giant reason for making others feel important: When\n",
      "you help others feel important, you help yourself feel important too.\n",
      "One of the elevator operators who carried me up and down for several\n",
      "months had the look of complete unimportance written all over. She was\n",
      "fiftyish, bored, and certainly uninspired in her work. It was obvious that her\n",
      "longing to be important was completely unfulfilled. She was one of the\n",
      "millions of people who live for months at a time without ever being given a\n",
      "reason to believe that someone notices them or cares about them.\n",
      "One morning shortly after I became one of her regular “uppers and\n",

      "So I said, “Miss S. (Note: I had learned her name), I do like what you’ve\n",

      "self-importance are slated for mediocrity. Again and again this point must\n",
      "be driven home: You must feel important to succeed. Helping others to feel\n",
      "important rewards you because it makes you feel more important. Try it and\n",
      "see. Here’s how to do it:\n",
      "1. Practice appreciation. Make it a rule to let others know you appreciate\n",
      "what they do for you. Never, never let anyone feel he is taken for\n",
      "granted. Practice appreciation with a warm, sincere smile. A smile lets\n",
      "others know you notice them and feel kindly toward them.\n",
      "Practice appreciation by letting others know how you depend on\n",
      "them. An earnest “Jim, I don’t know what we’d do without you” type\n",
      "of remark makes people feel necessary, and when they feel necessary\n",
      "they do increasingly better work.\n",
      "Practice appreciation with honest, personalized compliments. People\n",
      "thrive on compliments—whether two or twenty, nine or ninety, a\n",
      "person craves praise. He wants to be assured that he’s doing a good\n",
      "job, that he is important. Don’t feel that you should hand out praise\n",
      "only for big accomplishments. Compliment people on little things:\n",
      "their appearance, the way they do their routine work, their ideas, their\n",
      "loyal efforts. Praise by writing personal notes complimenting people\n",
      "you know on their achievements. Make a special phone call or a\n",
      "special trip to see them.\n",
      "Don’t waste time or mental energy trying to classify people as “very\n",
      "important persons,” “important persons,” or “unimportant persons.”\n",
      "Make no exceptions. A person, whether he is garbage collector or\n",
      "company vice president, is important to you. Treating someone as\n",
      "second-class never gets you first-class results.\n",
      "2. Practice calling people by their names. Every year shrewd manufacturers\n",
      "sell more briefcases, pencils, computers, and hundreds of other items just\n",
      "by putting the buyer’s name on the product. People like to be called by\n",
      "name. It gives everyone a boost to be addressed by name.\n",
      "Two special things you must remember. Pronounce the name\n",
      "correctly, and spell it correctly. If you mispronounce or misspell\n",
      "someone’s name, that person feels that you feel he is unimportant.\n",
      "And here’s one special reminder: When talking with people you\n",
      "don’t know well, add the appropriate title—Miss, Mister, or Mrs. The\n",
      "office boy prefers Mr. Jones to just Jones. So does your junior\n",
      "assistant. So do people at every level. These little titles help\n",
      "tremendously to make people feel important.\n",
      "3. Don’t hog glory, invest it instead. Just recently I was a guest at an all-day\n",
      "sales convention. After dinner that evening the vice president in charge\n",
      "of sales for the company passed out awards to the two district managers,\n",
      "a man and a woman, whose sales organizations had attained the best\n",
      "records for the year just ended. Then the vice president asked those\n",
      "district managers to take fifteen minutes to tell the entire group how their\n",
      "organizations did so exceptionally well.\n",
      "The first district manager (who, I later learned, had been appointed a\n",
      "manager only three months before and was therefore only partially\n",
      "responsible for his organization’s record) got up and explained how he\n",
      "did it.\n",
      "He conveyed the impression that his efforts and his efforts alone\n",
      "caused the sales increase. Remarks such as “When I took over, I did\n",
      "such-and-such”; “Things were in a mess but I cleared them up”; “It\n",
      "wasn’t easy but I just grabbed hold of the situation and wouldn’t let\n",
      "go” characterized his talk.\n",
      "As he talked, I could see the increasing resentment gathering in the\n",
      "faces of his salesmen. They were being ignored for the sake of the\n",
      "district manager’s personal glory. Their hard work, which was\n",
      "responsible for the sales increase, was completely unrecognized.\n",
      "Then, the second district manger got up to make her short talk. But\n",
      "this lady used an entirely different approach. First, she explained that\n",
      "the reason for her organization’s success was the wholehearted effort\n",
      "of her sales force. Then she asked each one to stand and paid a sincere\n",
      "personal compliment to each for his or her efforts.\n",
      "Note this difference; the first manager squandered the vice\n",
      "president’s praise entirely on himself. In doing so, he offended his own\n",
      "people. His sales force was demoralized. The second passed the praise\n",
      "on to her sales force, where it could do more good. This manager knew\n",
      "that praise, like money, can be invested to pay dividends. She knew\n",
      "that passing the credit on to her salespeople would make them work\n",
      "even harder next year.\n",
      "Remember, praise is power. Invest the praise you receive from your\n",
      "superior. Pass praise on down to your subordinates, where it will encourage\n",
      "still greater performance. When you share praise, your subordinates know\n",
      "you sincerely appreciate their value.\n",
      "Here’s a daily exercise that pays off surprisingly well. Ask yourself every\n",
      "day, “What can I do today to make my partner and family happy?”\n",
      "This may seem almost too simple, but it is amazingly effective. One\n",
      "evening, as part of a sales training program, I was discussing “Building the\n",
      "Home Environment for Selling Success.” To illustrate a point, I asked the\n",
      "salesmen (who were all married), “When was the last time, aside from\n",
      "Christmas, your wedding anniversary, or her birthday, that you surprised\n",
      "your wife with a special gift?”\n",
      "Even I was shocked at the answers. Of the thirty-five salesmen, only one\n",
      "had surprised his wife in the past month. Many of the group answered\n",
      "“between three and six months.” And over a third said, “I can’t remember.”\n",
      "I wanted to impress these salesmen with the power of the thoughtful gift.\n",
      "The next evening I arranged to have a florist appear just before the close of\n",
      "the session. I introduced him and leveled with them: “I want each of you to\n",
      "discover what a little unexpected remembrance will do to build a better\n",
      "home environment. I’ve arranged with the florist for each of you to get a\n",
      "fine, long-stemmed red rose for just 50 cents. Now if you don’t have 50\n",
      "cents I’ll buy the flower for her myself. All I ask is that you take the rose to\n",
      "your wife and then tomorrow evening tell us what happened.\n",
      "“Don’t, of course, tell her how you came to purchase this rose for her.”\n",
      "They understood.\n",
      "Without exception, every fellow testified the next evening that the mere\n",
      "investment of 50 cents had made his wife happy\n",
      "Do something special for your family often. It doesn’t have to be\n",
      "something expensive. It’s thoughtfulness that counts. Anything that shows\n",
      "that you put your family’s interests first will do the trick.\n",
      "Get the family on your team. Give them planned attention.\n",
      "In this busy age a lot of people never seem able to find time for their\n",
      "families. But if we plan, we can find it. One company vice president told\n",

      "THINK RIGHT TOWARD PEOPLE\n",
      "HERE IS A BASIC rule for winning success. Let’s mark it in the mind and remember\n",
      "it. The rule is: Success depends on the support of other people. The only\n",
      "hurdle between you and what you want to be is the support of others.\n",
      "Look at it this way: an executive depends on people to carry out his\n",
      "instructions. If they don’t, the company president will fire the executive, not\n",
      "the employees. A salesman depends on people to buy his product. If they\n",
      "don’t, the salesman fails. Likewise, a college dean depends on professors to\n",
      "carry forward his educational program; a politician depends on voters to\n",
      "elect him; a writer depends on people to read what he writes. A chain store\n",
      "magnate got to be a chain store magnate because employees accepted his\n",
      "leadership and consumers accepted his merchandising program.\n",
      "There were times in history when a person could gain a position of\n",
      "authority through force and hold it with force and/or threats of force. In\n",
      "those days a man either cooperated with the “leader” or risked literally\n",
      "losing his head.\n",
      "But today, remember, a person either supports you willingly or he doesn’t\n",
      "support you at all.\n",
      "Now it’s time to ask, “Granted, I depend on others in order to achieve the\n",
      "success I want, but what must I do to get these people to support me and\n",
      "accept my leadership?”\n",
      "The answer, wrapped up in one phrase, is think right toward people.\n",
      "Think right toward people, and they will like and support you. This chapter\n",
      "shows how.\n",
      "Thousands of times daily a scene like this takes place. A committee or\n",
      "group is in session. The purpose—to consider names for a promotion, a new\n",
      "job, a club membership, an honor—someone to be the new company\n",
      "president, the new supervisor, the new sales manager. A name is placed\n",
      "before the group. The chairman asks, “What is your feeling about so-and-\n",
      "so?”\n",
      "Comments come forth. For some names there are positive remarks, such\n",
      "as “He’s a good fellow. People there speak highly of him. He has a good\n",
      "technical background, too.”\n",
      "“Mr. F? Oh, he’s a personable sort of man, very human. I believe he\n",
      "would fit in well with our group.”\n",
      "Some names draw negative, lukewarm statements. “I think we should\n",
      "investigate that fellow carefully. He doesn’t seem to get along too well with\n",
      "people.”\n",
      "“I know he has a good academic and technical background; I don’t\n",
      "question his competence. But I am concerned about the acceptance he\n",
      "would receive. He doesn’t command much respect from people.”\n",
      "Now, here is an exceptionally important observation: In at least nine\n",
      "cases out of ten, the “likability” factor is the first thing mentioned. And in\n",
      "an overwhelmingly large number of cases, the “likability” factor is given\n",
      "far more weight than the technical factor.\n",
      "The above holds true even in selecting scholars for university\n",
      "professorships. In my own academic experience I’ve sat in on a\n",
      "considerable number of occasions when names for new faculty personnel\n",
      "were under question. When a name came up, the group would weigh most\n",
      "carefully thoughts such as “Will he fit in?” “Will students like him?” “Will\n",
      "he cooperate with others on the staff?”\n",
      "Unfair? Unacademic? No. If the fellow isn’t likable, he can’t be expected\n",
      "to get through to his students with maximum effectiveness.\n",
      "Mark this point well. A person is not pulled up to a higher-level job.\n",
      "Rather, he is lifted up. In this day and age nobody has time or patience to\n",
      "pull another up the job ladder, degree by painful degree. The individual is\n",
      "chosen whose record makes him stand higher than the rest.\n",
      "We are lifted to higher levels by those who know us as likable,\n",
      "personable individuals. Every friend you make lifts you just one notch\n",
      "higher. And being likable makes you lighter to lift.\n",
      "Successful people follow a plan for liking people. Do you? People who\n",
      "reach the top don’t discuss much their techniques for thinking right toward\n",
      "people. But you would be surprised how many really big people have a\n",
      "clear, definite, even written plan for liking people. Consider the case of\n",
      "President Lyndon Johnson. Long before he became president, Johnson, in\n",
      "the process of developing his amazing power of personal persuasion,\n",
      "developed his own ten-point formula for success. His rules, which even a\n",
      "casual observer of the president could see were practiced in everything he\n",
      "did, are quoted directly:\n",
      "1. Learn to remember names. Inefficiency at this point may indicate that\n",
      "your interest is not sufficiently outgoing.\n",
      "2. Be a comfortable person so there is no strain in being with you. Be an\n",
      "old-shoe kind of individual.\n",
      "3. Acquire the quality of relaxed easy-going so that things do not ruffle you.\n",
      "4. Don’t be egotistical. Guard against the impression that you know it all.\n",
      "5. Cultivate the quality of being interesting so people will get something of\n",
      "value from their association with you.\n",
      "6. Study to get the “scratchy” elements out of your personality, even those\n",
      "of which you may be unconscious.\n",
      "7. Sincerely attempt to heal, on an honest basis, every misunderstanding\n",
      "you have had or now have. Drain off your grievances.\n",
      "8. Practice liking people until you learn to do so genuinely.\n",
      "9. Never miss an opportunity to say a word of congratulation upon anyone’s\n",
      "achievement, or express sympathy in sorrow or disappointment.\n",
      "10. Give spiritual strength to people, and they will give genuine affection to\n",
      "you.\n",

      "After the delivery man left, my friend hastened to explain to me: “Don’t\n",
      "misunderstand. I like to give gifts and I like to get them.”\n",
      "Then he named a number of gifts he had already received from business\n",
      "friends that Christmas.\n",
      "“But,” he went on, “when the gift is just an attempt to get my business,\n",

      "them call us.” “Let her speak first.”\n",
      "It’s easy, too, virtually to ignore other people.\n",
      "Yes, it’s easy and natural, but it isn’t right thinking toward people. If you\n",

      "2. Be sure the other person gets your name straight.\n",
      "3. Be sure you can pronounce the other person’s name the way he\n",
      "pronounces it.\n",
      "4. Write down the other person’s name, and be mighty sure you have it\n",
      "spelled correctly; understandably people have a thing about the correct\n",
      "spelling of their own names! If possible, get their address and phone\n",
      "number, also.\n",
      "5. Drop a personal note or make a phone call to the new friends you feel\n",
      "you want to know better. This is an important point. Most successful\n",
      "people follow through on new friends with a letter or a phone call.\n",
      "6. And last but not least, say pleasant things to strangers. It warms you up\n",

      "Recently an associate and I were retained to do a preliminary screening\n",
      "of an applicant for an industrial sales job. We found the applicant, whom\n",
      "we’ll call Ted, to have some good qualifications. He was exceptionally\n",
      "intelligent, made a fine appearance, and seemed to have a lot of ambition.\n",
      "But we found something that forced us to disqualify him, at least\n",
      "temporarily. Ted’s big limitation was this: he expected perfection in other\n",
      "people. Ted was annoyed by many little things, like mistakes in grammar,\n",
      "people who were messy, people who had bad taste in clothes, and so on.\n",
      "Ted was surprised to learn this fact about himself. But he was eager to get\n",
      "into higher-paying work, and he asked whether there was anything we could\n",
      "tell him to help overcome his weakness.\n",
      "We made three suggestions:\n",
      "1. Recognize the fact that no person is perfect. Some people are more nearly\n",
      "perfect than others, but no man is absolutely perfect. The most human\n",
      "quality about human beings is that they make mistakes, all kinds of them.\n",
      "2. Recognize the fact that the other fellow has a right to be different. Never\n",
      "play God about anything. Never dislike people because their habits are\n",
      "different from your own or because they prefer different clothes, religion,\n",
      "parties, or automobiles. You don’t have to approve of what another\n",
      "fellow does, but you must not dislike him for doing it.\n",
      "3. Don’t be a reformer. Put a little more “live and let live” into your\n",
      "philosophy. Most people intensely dislike being told “you’re wrong.”\n",
      "You have a right to your own opinion, but sometimes it’s better to keep it\n",
      "to yourself.\n",
      "Ted conscientiously applied these suggestions. A few months later he had\n",
      "a fresh outlook. He now accepts people for what they are, neither 100\n",
      "percent good nor 100 percent bad.\n",
      "“Besides,” he says, “the things that used to annoy the heck out of me I\n",
      "now find amusing. It finally dawned on me what a dull world this would be\n",
      "if people were all alike and everybody was perfect.”\n",
      "Note this simple but key fact: No person is all good and no person is all\n",
      "bad. The perfect person just doesn’t exist.\n",
      "Now, if we let our thinking go uncontrolled, we can find much to dislike\n",
      "in almost anyone. By the same token, if we manage our thinking properly, if\n",
      "we think right toward people, we can find many qualities to like and admire\n",
      "in the same person.\n",

      "business superior (we’ll call him Mr. Jacobs) called you into his office and\n",
      "reviewed your work with you. He complimented you on your work, but he\n",
      "also made some specific suggestions on how you can do it better. Tonight\n",
      "it’s only natural for you to recall the incident and do some thinking about it.\n",
      "If you tune in Channel N, the announcer will be saying something like\n",
      "this: “Watch out! Jacobs is out to get you. He’s a crab. You don’t need any\n",
      "of his advice. To heck with it. Remember what Joe told you about Jacobs?\n",
      "He was right. Jacobs wants to grind you down like he did Joe. Resist him.\n",
      "Next time he calls you in, fight back. Better still, don’t wait. Tomorrow go\n",
      "in and ask him just what he really meant by his criticism.”\n",
      "But tune in Channel P, and the announcer will say something along these\n",
      "lines: “You know, Mr. Jacobs is a pretty good fellow. Those suggestions he\n",
      "made to me seem pretty sound. If I put them to use, I can probably do a\n",

      "In this specific case, if you listen to Channel N, you’re almost certain to\n",

      "your superior’s suggestions and at the same time draw yourself closer to\n",
      "him. He will appreciate that visit. Try it and see.\n",
      "Bear in mind that the longer you stay tuned to either Channel P or\n",
      "Channel N, the more interested you become and the harder it is to switch\n",
      "channels. This is true because one thought, positive or negative, sets off a\n",
      "whole chain reaction of similar thought.\n",
      "You may, for example, start off with such a simple minor negative\n",
      "thought as a person’s accent and find yourself soon thinking negatively\n",
      "about such unrelated topics as his political and religious beliefs, the car he\n",
      "drives, his personal habits, his relationship with his wife, even the way he\n",
      "combs his hair. And thinking this way surely won’t get you where you want\n",

      "switch, all you must do is think of one positive quality about the individual.\n",
      "In true chain reaction style, this one thought will lead to another and\n",
      "another. And you will be glad.\n",
      "When you are alone, you and only you can decide whether you will listen\n",
      "to Channel P or Channel N. But when you are talking with someone else,\n",
      "that person has a measure of control over how you think.\n",
      "We must remember that most people do not understand the concepts of\n",
      "thinking right toward people. So it’s a very common experience for people\n",
      "to come rushing to you, just aching to say something negative about a\n",
      "person you both know: a co-worker wants to tell you about the\n",
      "objectionable qualities of another employee; a neighbor wants to let you\n",
      "know the domestic problems of another neighbor; or a customer wants to\n",
      "itemize the faults of his competitor, whom you will call on next.\n",
      "Thoughts breed like thoughts. There is real danger that if you listen to\n",
      "negative comments about another person, you too will go negative toward\n",
      "that person. In fact, if you are not on guard, you may actually find yourself\n",
      "adding fuel to the fire with “Yes, and that’s not all. Did you hear, …” type\n",
      "of comment.\n",
      "These things backfire, boomerang.\n",
      "There are two ways to prevent others from switching us from Channel P\n",

      "about people, greater success is guaranteed. Let me tell you what an\n",
      "unusually successful insurance salesman told me about how thinking good\n",
      "thoughts about people pays off for him.\n",
      "“When I first got in the insurance business,” he began, “the going was\n",
      "tough, believe me. At first it seemed there were about as many competing\n",
      "agents as there were prospects. And I soon learned what all insurance men\n",
      "know, that nine prospects out of ten firmly believe they don’t need any\n",
      "more insurance.\n",
      "“I’m doing well. But let me tell you, it’s not because I know a lot about\n",
      "the technical side of insurance. That’s important, don’t misunderstand me,\n",
      "but there are men trying to sell insurance who know policies and contracts\n",
      "better than I. In fact, I know one man who wrote a book about insurance,\n",
      "but he couldn’t sell a policy to a man who knew he had only five days to\n",
      "live.\n",
      "“My success,” he continued, “is based on one thing. I like, really like the\n",
      "guy I’m selling. Let me say again, I really like him. Some of my fellow\n",
      "salesmen try to pretend they like the other fellow, but this won’t work. You\n",
      "can’t even fool a dog. Your mannerisms, eyes, facial expressions, all spell\n",
      "p-h-o-n-y when you pretend.\n",
      "“Now, when I’m gathering information about a prospect, I do what every\n",
      "other agent does. I get his age, where he works, how much he makes, how\n",
      "many kids he’s got, and so on.\n",
      "“But I also get something else which most salesmen never search for—\n",
      "that is, some sound reasons why I can like the prospect. Maybe the job he’s\n",
      "doing will supply the reason, or perhaps I can find it someplace in his past\n",
      "record. But I find some good reasons to like him.\n",
      "“Then, whenever my attention is focused on the prospect, I review the\n",
      "reasons why I like him. I build a likable image of the prospect before I say\n",
      "one word to him about insurance.\n",
      "“This little technique works. Because I like him, he sooner or later likes\n",
      "me. Pretty soon, instead of sitting across the table from him, I’m on the\n",
      "same side with him, and we’re working out his insurance plan together. He\n",
      "trusts and believes in my judgment because I am a friend.\n",
      "“Now, people don’t always accept me right off the bat, but I’ve found\n",
      "that so long as I continue to like a fellow, he’ll come around, and we can get\n",
      "down to business,\n",
      "“Just last week,” my friend went on, “I was making the third call on a\n",
      "difficult prospect. He met me at the door, and before I could even say\n",
      "‘Good evening,’ he proceeded to give me hell. He went on and on, not even\n",
      "stopping for a breath until he had run down and finished with, And don’t\n",
      "ever come back here again.’\n",
      "“After he had said that, I just stood there looking into his eyes for about\n",

      "as you can. Note two things: which person in the conversation does the\n",
      "most talking and which person is the more successful.\n",
      "Hundreds of my own little experiments have revealed this: The person\n",
      "who does the most talking and the person who is the most successful are\n",
      "rarely the same person. Almost without exception, the more successful the\n",
      "person, the more he practices conversation generosity, that is, he\n",
      "encourages the other person to talk about himself, his views, his\n",
      "accomplishments, his family, his job, his problems. Conversation generosity\n",
      "paves the way to greater success in two important ways:\n",
      "1. Conversation generosity wins friends.\n",
      "2. Conversation generosity helps you learn more about people.\n",
      "Remember this: the average person would rather talk about himself than\n",
      "anything else in this world. When you give him the chance, he likes you for\n",
      "it. Conversation generosity is the easiest, simplest, and surest way there is\n",
      "to win a friend.\n",
      "The second benefit of conversation generosity, learning more about other\n",
      "people, is important, too. As we said in Chapter 1, people are what we study\n",
      "in our success lab. The more we can learn about them, their thought\n",
      "processes, their strong and weak points, why they do what and as they do,\n",
      "the better equipped we are to influence them effectively, in the way that we\n",
      "want.\n",
      "Let me illustrate.\n",
      "A large New York advertising agency, like all advertising agencies,\n",
      "specializes of course in telling the public why it should buy the products it\n",
      "advertises. But this agency does something else, too. It requires its\n",
      "copywriters to spend one week each year behind counters so they can listen\n",
      "to what people say about the products they promote. Listening provides the\n",
      "clues these copywriters need to write better, more effective ads.\n",
      "Many progressive businesses conduct so-called terminal interviews with\n",
      "employees who are leaving. The reason is not to sell the employees on\n",
      "staying with the company but to find out why he is quitting. Then the\n",
      "company can bring about improvements in its employee relations. Listening\n",
      "pays off.\n",
      "Listening pays off for the salesman, too. Often people think of a good\n",
      "salesman as a “good talker” or a “fast talker.” Sales managers, however, are\n",
      "not as impressed by a good talker as they are by a good listener, a fellow\n",
      "who can ask questions and get desired answers.\n",
      "Don’t be a conversation hog. Listen, win friends, and learn.\n",
      "Courtesy practiced in every relationship with another person is the finest\n",
      "tranquilizer you can use. No commercial preparation is one-tenth as\n",
      "effective in relaxing you as doing little things for other people. Thinking\n",
      "right toward people removes frustrations and stress. When you boil it all\n",
      "down, the big cause of stress is negative feelings toward other people. So\n",
      "think positive toward people and discover how wonderful, really wonderful\n",
      "this world is.\n",
      "The real test for thinking right toward people comes when things don’t go\n",
      "exactly the way we want. How do you think when you’re passed up for a\n",
      "promotion? Or when you fail to win an office in a club you belong to? Or\n",
      "when you’re criticized for the job you’ve done? Remember this: how you\n",
      "think when you lose determines how long it will be until you win.\n",
      "The answer for thinking right toward people when things don’t go\n",
      "exactly our way comes from Benjamin Fairless, one of the 20th century’s\n",

      "always figured it was my fault that the discipline was necessary. I have also\n",

      "he expected if I possibly could, never less.\n",
      "“I have had some disappointments, times when I greatly wanted a\n",
      "promotion and somebody else got it. But I never figured that I was the\n",
      "victim of ‘office politics’ or prejudice or bad judgment on the boss’s part.\n",
      "Instead of sulking or quitting in a huff, I reasoned things out. Obviously the\n",
      "other fellow deserved the promotion more than I did. What could I do to\n",
      "make myself deserving of the next opportunity? At the same time I never\n",
      "got angry with myself for losing and never wasted any time berating\n",
      "myself.” Remember Benjamin Fairless when things go wrong. Just do two\n",
      "things:\n",
      "1. Ask yourself, “What can I do to make myself more deserving of the next\n",

      "agree to before they got married. The document, neatly typed and looking\n",
      "very legal, covered every segment of living G. N. could think of. There was\n",
      "one section on religion: what church they would go to, how often they\n",
      "would attend, how much they would donate. Another section covered\n",
      "children: how many and when.\n",
      "In detail, G. N. outlined the kind of friends they would have, his future\n",
      "wife’s employment status, where they would live, how their income would\n",
      "be spent. To finish the document, G. N. devoted half a page to listing\n",
      "specific habits the woman must break or must acquire. This covered such\n",
      "habits as smoking, drinking, makeup, entertainment, and so on.\n",
      "When G. N.’s prospective bride reviewed his ultimatum, she did what\n",
      "you would expect. She rightly sent it back with a note saying, “The usual\n",
      "marriage clause, ‘for better or for worse,’ is good enough for everyone else\n",

      "NEW HOME\n",
      "In every big decision, the mind battles with itself—to act or not to act, to do\n",
      "or not to do. Here’s how one young fellow elected to act and reaped big\n",
      "rewards.\n",
      "J. M.’s situation is similar to that of a million other young men. He is in\n",

      "But there was a hitch to buying a new home—the down payment. One\n",
      "day as J. M. was writing next month’s rent check he became very disgusted\n",
      "with himself. He observed that the rent payment was as much as monthly\n",
      "payments on a new home.\n",
      "J. M. called his wife and said, “How would you like to buy a new home\n",
      "next week?” “What’s got into you?” she asked. “Why make jokes? You\n",
      "know we can’t. We haven’t even got the money for the down payment.”\n",
      "But J. M. was determined. “There are hundreds of thousands of couples\n",
      "like us who are going to buy a new home ‘someday,’ but only about half of\n",
      "them ever do. Something always comes up to stop them. We’re going to\n",
      "buy a home. I don’t know yet how we’ll raise the down payment, but we\n",
      "will.”\n",
      "Well, the next week they found a house they both liked, quite\n",
      "unpretentious but nice, for $1,200 down. Now the obstacle was to find a\n",
      "way to raise $1,200. J. M. knew he couldn’t borrow it through the usual\n",
      "channels, for this would encumber his credit so that he couldn’t get a\n",
      "mortgage for the sale price.\n",
      "Where there’s a will there’s always a way. Suddenly, J. M. got a\n",
      "brainstorm: Why not contact the builder and work out a private loan\n",
      "arrangement for $1,200? This J. M. did. At first, the builder was cold to the\n",
      "idea, but J. M. persisted. Finally, it was agreed. The builder would, in effect,\n",
      "advance J. M. the $1,200, to be repaid at $100 a month plus interest.\n",
      "Now all J. M. had to do was to “find” $100 a month. Mr. and Mrs. J. M.\n",
      "sharpened their pencils and figured out a way to cut expenditures $25 a\n",
      "month. But that still left $75, which J. M. would have to raise each month.\n",
      "Then J. M. got another idea. The next morning he went in to see his boss.\n",
      "He explained to his employer what he was doing. His boss was glad to learn\n",
      "that J. M. was going to buy a new home.\n",
      "Then J. M. said, “Look, Mr. T, to work this deal out, I’ve got to earn at\n",
      "least $75 more each month. Now, I know,” J. M. continued, “you’ll give me\n",
      "a raise when you feel that I deserve it. What I want now is just a chance to\n",
      "earn more money. There are some things around here that could best be\n",
      "done on weekends. Will you make it possible for me to work then?”\n",
      "The employer was impressed with J. M.’s sincerity and ambition. He\n",
      "proposed a way for J. M. to work ten extra hours each weekend, and Mr.\n",

      "him to take action in other major situations.\n",

      "CASE NO. 3: C. D. WANTED TO START\n",
      "HIS OWN BUSINESS, BUT …\n",
      "Mr. C. D. represents another case of what happens to big ideas when one\n",
      "waits until conditions are perfect before taking action on those ideas.\n",
      "Shortly after World War II, C. D. got a job with the Customs Division of\n",
      "the U.S. Post Office Department. He liked his work, but after five years he\n",
      "became dissatisfied with the confinement, regular hours, low pay, and the\n",
      "seniority system with its relatively narrow chances for advancement,\n",
      "Then he got an idea. He had learned a great deal about what it takes to be\n",
      "a successful importer. Why not set himself up in the business of importing\n",
      "low-cost gift items and toys? C. D. knew many successful importers who\n",
      "didn’t have his knowledge of the ins and outs of this business.\n",
      "It’s been ten years now since C. D. decided he wanted to go into business\n",
      "for himself. But today, he’s still working for the Customs Office.\n",
      "Why? Well, every time C. D. was just about ready to cut loose on his\n",
      "own, something happened that stopped him from taking action. Lack of\n",
      "money, economic recession, new baby, need for temporary security, trade\n",
      "restrictions, and more excuses all served as reasons for waiting, for\n",
      "postponing.\n",
      "The real truth is that C. D. let himself develop into a passivationist. He\n",
      "wanted conditions to be perfect before he took action. Since conditions\n",
      "were never perfect, C. D. never took action.\n",
      "Here are two things to do to help you avoid the costly mistake of waiting\n",
      "until conditions are perfect before you act.\n",
      "1. Expect future obstacles and difficulties. Every venture presents risks,\n",
      "problems, and uncertainties. Let’s suppose you wanted to drive your car\n",
      "from Chicago to Los Angeles, but you insisted on waiting until you had\n",
      "absolute assurance that there would be no detours, no motor trouble, no\n",
      "bad weather, no drunken drivers, no risk of any kind. When would you\n",
      "start? Never! In planning your trip to Los Angeles it makes sense to map\n",
      "your route, check your car, in other ways to eliminate as much risk as\n",
      "possible before you start. But you can’t eliminate all risks.\n",
      "2. Meet problems and obstacles as they arise. The test of a successful\n",
      "person is not the ability to eliminate all problems before he takes action,\n",
      "but rather the ability to find solutions to difficulties when he encounters\n",
      "them. In business, marriage, or in any activity, cross bridges when you\n",
      "come to them.\n",
      "We can’t buy an insurance policy against all problems.\n",
      "Make up your mind to do something about your ideas. Five or six years\n",
      "ago a very capable professor told me of his plans for writing a book, a\n",
      "biography of a controversial personality of a few decades ago. His ideas\n",
      "were more than interesting; they were alive, fascinating. The professor\n",
      "knew what he wanted to say, and he had the skill and energy to say it. The\n",
      "project was destined to reward him with much inner satisfaction, prestige,\n",
      "and money.\n",
      "Last spring I saw my friend again, and I innocently asked him whether\n",
      "the book was about finished. (This was a blunder; it opened up an old\n",
      "wound.)\n",
      "No, he hadn’t written the book. He struggled with himself for a moment\n",
      "as if he were debating with himself whether to explain why. Finally he\n",
      "explained that he had been too busy, he had more “responsibilities” and just\n",
      "couldn’t get to it.\n",
      "In reality, what the professor had done was to bury the idea deep in his\n",
      "mental graveyard. He let his mind grow negative thoughts. He visualized\n",
      "the tremendous work and sacrifices that would be involved. He saw all sorts\n",
      "of reasons why the project would fail.\n",
      "Ideas are important. Let’s make no mistake about that. We must have\n",
      "ideas to create and improve anything. Success shuns the man who lacks\n",
      "ideas.\n",
      "But let’s make no mistakes about this point either. Ideas in themselves are\n",
      "not enough. That idea for getting more business, for simplifying work\n",
      "procedures, is of value only when it is acted upon.\n",
      "Every day thousands of people bury good ideas because they are afraid to\n",
      "act on them.\n",
      "And afterward, the ghosts of those ideas come back to haunt them.\n",
      "Put these two thoughts deep in your mind. First, give your ideas value by\n",
      "acting on them. Regardless of how good the idea, unless you do something\n",
      "with it, you gain nothing.\n",
      "Second, act on your ideas and gain mind tranquillity. Someone once said\n",
      "that the saddest word of tongue or pen are these: it might have been. Every\n",
      "day you hear someone saying something like “Had I gone into business\n",
      "seven years ago, I’d sure be sitting pretty now.” Or “I had a hunch it would\n",
      "work out like that. I wish I had done something about it.” A good idea if not\n",
      "acted upon produces terrible psychological pain. But a good idea acted\n",
      "upon brings enormous mental satisfaction.\n",
      "Got a good idea? Then do something about it,\n",
      "Use action to cure fear and gain confidence. Here’s something to\n",
      "remember. Action feeds and strengthens confidence; inaction in all forms\n",
      "feeds fear. To fight fear, act. To increase fear—wait, put off, postpone.\n",
      "Once I heard a young paratrooper instructor explain, “The jump really\n",
      "isn’t so bad. It’s the waiting to jump that gets a fellow. On the trip to the\n",
      "jump site I always try to make the time pass quickly for the men. It’s\n",
      "happened more than once that a trainee thought too much about what may\n",
      "happen and panicked. If we can’t get him to jump the next trip, he’s through\n",
      "as a paratrooper. Instead of gaining confidence, the longer he postpones the\n",
      "jump, the more scared he gets.”\n",

      "out. The youngster had been over-stimulated by a science fiction film and\n",
      "was afraid the little green monsters were going to enter his room and kidnap\n",
      "him. I was intrigued by the way the boy’s father relieved the lad’s worry. He\n",
      "didn’t say, “Don’t worry, son, nothing is going to get you. Go back to\n",
      "sleep.” Instead he took positive action. He made quite a show for the boy by\n",
      "inspecting the windows to be sure they were tight. Then he picked up one of\n",
      "the boy’s plastic guns and put it on a table beside his bed and said, “Billy,\n",
      "here’s a gun for you just in case.” The little fellow had a look of complete\n",
      "relief. Four minutes later he was fast asleep.\n",
      "Many physicians give neutral, harmless “medication” to people who\n",

      "Dread making a certain phone call? Make it, and dread disappears. Put it\n",
      "off, and it will get harder and harder to make.\n",
      "Dread going to a doctor for a checkup? Go, and your worry vanishes.\n",
      "Chances are nothing serious is wrong with you, and if there is, you know\n",

      "that we couldn’t accomplish the task, but rather fear of what our associates\n",

      "It’s natural to want to belong, to be accepted, to have group approval. But\n",
      "ask yourself, “Which group do I want to have accept me: the group that\n",

      "obstacles and difficulties and solve them as they arise.\n",

      "disappears. Just try it and see.\n",

      "Start acting instead.\n",

      "to arrange for the young man to have interviews with several possible\n",
      "employers would not help him. Trial and error is a pretty poor way to select\n",
      "a career. With dozens of career possibilities, the odds of stumbling into the\n",

      "before he starts going some place careerwise, he’s got to know where that\n",
      "someplace is.\n",
      "So I said, “Let’s look at your career plan from this angle. Will you\n",
      "describe for me your image of yourself ten years from now?” F. B.,\n",
      "obviously studying the question, finally said, “Well, I guess I want what just\n",

      "Really, though,” he continued, “I haven’t given it too much thought.”\n",
      "This, I assured him, was quite natural. I went on to explain that his\n",
      "approach to selecting a career was like going to an airline ticket counter and\n",
      "saying “Give me a ticket.” The people selling the tickets just can’t help you\n",
      "unless you give them a destination. So I said, “And I can’t help you find a\n",
      "job until I know what your destination is, and only you can tell me that.”\n",
      "This jarred F. B. into thinking. We spent the next two hours not talking\n",
      "about the merits of different kinds of jobs, but rather discussing how to set\n",
      "goals. F. B. learned, I believe, the most important lesson in career planning:\n",
      "Before you start out, know where you want to go.\n",
      "Like the progressive corporation, plan ahead. You are in a sense a\n",
      "business unit. Your talent, skills, and abilities are your “products,” You\n",
      "want to develop your products so they command the highest possible price.\n",
      "Forward planning will do it.\n",
      "Here are two steps that will help:\n",
      "First, visualize your future in terms of three departments: work, home,\n",
      "and social. Dividing your life this way keeps you from becoming confused,\n",
      "prevents conflicts, helps you look at the whole picture.\n",
      "Second, demand of yourself clear, precise answers to these questions:\n",
      "What do I want to accomplish with my life? What do I want to be? and\n",
      "What does it take to satisfy me?\n",

      "I recall a conversation with a very promising young writer on a college\n",
      "newspaper. This fellow had ability. If anyone showed promise for a career\n",

      "dime a dozen, and I don’t want to starve.”\n",
      "I didn’t see or hear from Dan for five years. Then one evening I chanced\n",
      "to meet him in New Orleans. Dan was working as an assistant personnel\n",

      "my heart isn’t in it. I wish now I’d gone with a publisher or newspaper\n",
      "when I finished school.”\n",
      "Dan’s attitude reflected boredom, uninterest. He was cynical about many\n",
      "things. He will never achieve maximum success until he quits his present\n",
      "job and gets into journalism. Success requires heart-and-soul effort, and you\n",
      "can put your heart and soul only into something you really desire.\n",
      "Had Dan followed his desire, he could have risen to the very top in some\n",

      "All of us have desires. All of us dream of what we really want to do. But\n",
      "few of us actually surrender to desire. Instead of surrendering to desire, we\n",
      "murder it. Five weapons are used to commit success suicide. Destroy them.\n",
      "They’re dangerous.\n",
      "1. Self-deprecation. You have heard dozens of people say, “I would like to\n",
      "be a doctor (or an executive or a commercial artist or in business for\n",
      "myself) but I can’t do it.” “I lack brains.” “I’d fail if I tried.” “I lack the\n",
      "education and/or experience.” Many young folks destroy desire with the\n",
      "old negative self-deprecation.\n",
      "2. “Security-itis.” Persons who say, “I’ve got security where I am” use the\n",
      "security weapons to murder their dreams.\n",
      "3. Competition. “The field is already overcrowded,” “People in that field\n",
      "are standing on top of each other” are remarks which kill desire fast.\n",
      "4. Parental dictation. I’ve heard hundreds of young people explain their\n",
      "career choice with “I’d really like to prepare for something else, but my\n",
      "parents want me to do this so I must.” Most parents, I believe, do not\n",
      "intentionally dictate to their children what they must do. What all\n",
      "intelligent parents want is to see their children live successfully. If the\n",
      "young person will patiently explain why he or she prefers a different\n",
      "career, and if the parent will listen, there will be no friction. The\n",
      "objectives of both the parent and the young person for the young person’s\n",
      "career are identical: success.\n",
      "5. Family responsibility. The attitude of “It would have been wise for me to\n",
      "change over five years ago, but now I’ve got a family and I can’t\n",
      "change,” illustrates this kind of desire murder weapon.\n",
      "Throw away those murder weapons! Remember, the only way to get full\n",
      "power, to develop full go force, is to do what you want to do. Surrender to\n",
      "desire and gain energy, enthusiasm, mental zip, and even better health.\n",
      "And it’s never too late to let desire take over.\n",
      "The overwhelming majority of really successful people work much\n",
      "longer than forty hours a week. And you don’t hear them complain of\n",
      "overwork. Successful people have their eyes focused on a goal, and this\n",
      "provides energy.\n",
      "The point is this: energy increases, multiplies, when you set a desired\n",
      "goal and resolve to work toward that goal. Many people, millions of them,\n",
      "can find new energy by selecting a goal and giving all they’ve got to\n",
      "accomplish that goal. Goals cure boredom. Goals even cure many chronic\n",

      "Let’s probe a little deeper into the power of goals. When you surrender\n",
      "yourself to your desires, when you let yourself become obsessed with a\n",
      "goal, you receive the physical power, energy, and enthusiasm needed to\n",
      "accomplish your goal. But you receive something else, something equally\n",
      "valuable. You receive the “automatic instrumentation” needed to keep you\n",
      "going straight to your objective.\n",
      "The most amazing thing about a deeply entrenched goal is that it keeps\n",
      "you on course to reach your target. This isn’t double-talk. What happens is\n",
      "this. When you surrender to your goal, the goal works itself into your\n",
      "subconscious mind. Your subconscious mind is always in balance. Your\n",
      "conscious mind is not, unless it is in tune with what your subconscious\n",
      "mind is thinking. Without full cooperation from the subconscious mind, a\n",
      "person is hesitant, confused, indecisive. Now, with your goal absorbed into\n",
      "your subconscious mind you react the right way automatically. The\n",
      "conscious mind is free for clear, straight thinking.\n",
      "Let’s illustrate this with two hypothetical persons. As you read on you’ll\n",
      "recognize these characters among the real people you know. We’ll call them\n",
      "Tom and Jack. These fellows are comparable in all respects except one:\n",
      "Tom has a firmly entrenched goal; Jack does not. Tom has a crystal-clear\n",
      "image of what he wants to be. He pictures himself as a corporation vice\n",
      "president ten years hence.\n",
      "Because Tom has surrendered to his goal, his goal through his\n",
      "subconscious mind signals to him saying “do this” or “don’t do that; it\n",
      "won’t help get you where you want to go.” The goal constantly speaks, “I\n",
      "am the image you want to make real. Here is what you must do to make me\n",
      "real.”\n",
      "Tom’s goal does not pilot him in vague generalities. It gives him specific\n",
      "directions in all his activities. When Tom buys a suit, the goal speaks and\n",
      "shows Tom the wise choice. The goal helps to show Tom what steps to take\n",
      "to move up to the next job, what to say in the business conference, what to\n",
      "do when conflict develops, what to read, what stand to take. Should Tom\n",
      "drift a little off course, his automatic instrumentation, housed securely in his\n",
      "subconscious mind, alerts him and tells him what to do to get back on\n",
      "course.\n",
      "Tom’s goal has made him supersensitive to all the many forces at work\n",
      "that affect him.\n",
      "Jack, on the other hand, lacking a goal, also lacks the automatic\n",
      "instrumentation to guide him. He is easily confused. His actions reflect no\n",
      "personal policy. Jack wavers, shifts, guesses at what to do. Lacking\n",
      "consistency of purpose, Jack flounders on the rutty road to mediocrity.\n",
      "May I suggest you reread the above section, right now. Let this concept\n",
      "soak in. Then look around you. Study the very top echelon of successful\n",

      "objective. Observe how the life of a highly successful person is integrated\n",

      "Reader’s Digest (April 1957) that the best advice he ever received was the\n",
      "principle of the “next mile.” Here’s part of what he said:\n",
      "“During World War II, I and several others had to parachute from a\n",
      "crippled Army transport plane into the mountainous jungle on the Burma-\n",
      "India border. It was several weeks before an armed relief expedition could\n",
      "reach us, and then we began a painful, plodding march. We were faced by a\n",
      "140-mile trek, over mountains, in August heat and monsoon rains.\n",
      "“In the first hour of the march I rammed a boot nail deep into one foot;\n",
      "by evening I had bleeding blisters the size of a 50 cent piece on both feet.\n",
      "Could I hobble 140 miles? Could the others, some in worse shape than I,\n",
      "complete such a distance? We were convinced we could not. But we could\n",
      "hobble to that ridge, we could make the next friendly village for the night.\n",
      "And that, of course, was all we had to do….\n",
      "“When I relinquished my job and income to undertake a book of a\n",
      "quarter of a million words, I could not bear to let my mind dwell on the\n",
      "whole scope of the project. I would surely have abandoned what has\n",
      "become my deepest source of professional pride. I tried to think only of the\n",
      "next paragraph, not the next page and certainly not the next chapter. Thus,\n",
      "for six solid months, I never did anything but set down one paragraph after\n",
      "another. The book ‘wrote itself.’\n",

      "get a job, but it will not guarantee your progress on the job. “Business is\n",
      "interested in competency, not diplomas.”\n",

      "get you where you want to go. More and more we depend on books, files,\n",
      "and machines to warehouse information. If we can do only what a machine\n",
      "can do, we’re in a real fix.\n",
      "Real education, the kind worth investing in, is that which develops and\n",

      "others of similar status.\n",
      "Many people earn degrees in evening programs these days, but the\n",
      "degree, which in the final analysis is only a piece of paper, is not their\n",
      "primary motivation. They are going to school to build their minds, which is\n",
      "a sure way to invest in a better future.\n",
      "And make no mistake about this. Education is a real bargain. A moderate\n",
      "investment will keep you in school one night each week for a full year.\n",

      "goals to get things done. Set goals and discover the real enjoyment of\n",
      "living.\n",
      "4. Let your major goal be your automatic pilot. When you let your goal\n",
      "absorb you, you’ll find yourself making the right decisions to reach your\n",
      "goal.\n",
      "5. Achieve your goal one step at a time. Regard each task you perform,\n",
      "regardless of how small it may seem, as a step toward your goal.\n",
      "6. Build thirty-day goals. Day-by-day effort pays off.\n",
      "7. Take detours in your stride. A detour simply means another route. It\n",
      "should never mean surrendering the goal.\n",
      "8. Invest in yourself. Purchase those things that build mental power and\n",

      "“What was that?” I asked.\n",

      "Working through his secretary and two other women employees, he set\n",
      "up office birthday parties for each member of the staff. The thirty minutes\n",
      "or so required for this was not a cost; rather, it was an investment in getting\n",
      "loyalty and output.\n",
      "When he learned that one of his staff members belonged to a minority\n",

      "holidays.\n",
      "When an employee or someone in the employee’s family was ill, John\n",
      "remembered. He took time to compliment his staff individually for their off-\n",
      "the-job accomplishments.\n",
      "But the largest evidence of John’s be-human philosophy showed up in the\n",
      "way he handled a dismissal problem. One of the employees who had been\n",
      "hired by John’s predecessor simply lacked the aptitude and interest for the\n",
      "work involved. John handled the problem magnificently. He did not use the\n",
      "conventional procedure of calling the employee into his office and giving\n",
      "him, first, the bad news and then, second, fifteen or thirty days to move out.\n",
      "Instead, he did two unusual things. First, he explained why it would be to\n",
      "the employee’s personal advantage to find a new situation where his\n",
      "aptitudes and interests would be more useful. He worked with the employee\n",
      "and put him in touch with a reputable vocational guidance consultant. Next,\n",
      "he did something else above and beyond the call of duty. He helped the\n",
      "employee find a new job by setting up interviews with executives in other\n",
      "companies where the employee’s skills were needed. In just eighteen days\n",
      "after the “dismissal” conference the employee was relocated in a very\n",
      "promising situation.\n",
      "This dismissal procedure intrigued me, so I asked John to explain his\n",
      "thinking behind it. He explained it this way: “There’s an old maxim I’ve\n",
      "formed and held in my mind,” he began. “Whoever is under a man’s power\n",
      "is under his protection, too. We never should have hired this man in the first\n",
      "place because he’s not cut out for this kind of work. But since we did, the\n",
      "least I could do was help him to relocate.\n",
      "“Anybody,” John continued, “can hire a man. But the test of leadership is\n",
      "how one handles the dismissal. By helping that employee relocate before he\n",
      "left us built up a feeling of job security in everyone in my department. I let\n",
      "them know by example that no one gets dumped on the street as long as I’m\n",
      "here.”\n",
      "Make no mistake. John’s be-human brand of leadership paid off. There\n",
      "were no secret gossip sessions about John. He received unquestioned\n",
      "loyalty and support. He had maximum job security because he gave\n",
      "maximum job security to his subordinates.\n",
      "For about fifteen years I’ve been close to a fellow I’ll call Bob W. Bob is\n",
      "in his late fifties. He came up the hard way. With a hit-or-miss education\n",
      "and no money, Bob found himself out of work in 1931. But he’s always\n",
      "been a scrambler. Not one to be idle, Bob started an upholstery shop in his\n",

      "human beings want to be treated.\n",
      "One day Bob and I were discussing the matter of criticizing people.\n",

      "“I don’t think you could find anybody who would say I’m a softie or a\n",
      "weakling. I run a business. When something isn’t going right, I fix it. But\n",
      "it’s the way I fix it—that’s important. If employees are doing something\n",
      "wrong or are making a mistake, I am doubly careful not to hurt their\n",
      "feelings and make them feel small or embarrassed. I just use four simple\n",
      "steps:\n",
      "“First, I talk to them privately.\n",

      "me because I’ve found that’s exactly the way they like it. When they walk\n",
      "out of this office, they have been reminded that they are not only pretty\n",
      "good, they can be even better.\n",
      "“I’ve been betting on people all my life,” Bob says. “And the better I\n",
      "treat them, the more good things happen to me. I honestly don’t plan it that\n",

      "“Let me give you an example. Back about, oh, five or six years ago, one\n",
      "of the production men came to work drunk. Pretty soon there was a\n",
      "commotion in the plant. It seems this fellow had taken a five-gallon can of\n",
      "lacquer and was splashing it all over the place. Well, the other workmen\n",
      "took the lacquer away from him, and the plant superintendent escorted him\n",
      "out.\n",
      "“I walked outside and found him sitting against the building in a kind of\n",
      "stupor. I helped him up, put him in my car, and took him to his home. His\n",
      "wife was frantic. I tried to reassure her that everything would be all right.\n",
      "‘Oh, but you don’t understand,’ she said. ‘Mr. W. [me] doesn’t stand for\n",
      "anyone being drunk on the job. Jim’s lost his job, and now what will we\n",
      "do?’ I told her Jim wouldn’t be dismissed. She asked how I knew. The\n",
      "reason, I explained, is because I’m Mr. W.\n",
      "“She almost fainted. I told her I’d do all I could to help Jim at the plant\n",
      "and I hoped she’d do all she could at home; and just have him on the job in\n",
      "the morning.\n",
      "“When I got back to the plant, I went down to Jim’s department and\n",
      "spoke to Jim’s co-workers. I told them, ‘You’ve seen something unpleasant\n",
      "here today but I want you to forget it, Jim will be back tomorrow. Be kind\n",
      "to him. He’s been a good worker for a long time, and we owe it to him to\n",
      "give him another chance.’\n",
      "“Jim got back on the ball, and his drinking was never again a problem. I\n",
      "soon forgot about the incident. But Jim didn’t. Two years ago the\n",
      "headquarters of the local union sent some men here to negotiate the contract\n",
      "for the local. They had some staggering, simply unrealistic demands. Jim—\n",
      "quiet, meek Jim—suddenly became a leader. He got busy and reminded the\n",
      "fellows in the plant that they’d always gotten a fair deal from Mr. W. and\n",
      "we didn’t need outsiders coming to tell us how to run our affairs.\n",
      "“The outsiders left, and as usual we negotiated our contract like friends,\n",
      "thanks to Jim.”\n",
      "Here are two ways to use the be-human approach to make you a better\n",
      "leader. First, each time you face a difficult matter, involving people, ask\n",
      "yourself, “What is the human way to handle this?”\n",
      "Ponder over this question when there is a disagreement among your\n",
      "subordinates or when an employee creates a problem.\n",
      "Remember Bob W.’s formula for helping others correct their mistakes.\n",
      "Avoid sarcasm. Avoid being cynical. Avoid taking people down a peg or\n",
      "two. Avoid putting others in their place.\n",
      "Ask, “What is the human way to deal with people?” It always pays—\n",
      "sometimes sooner, sometimes later, but it always pays.\n",
      "A second way to profit from the be-human rule is to let your action show\n",
      "you put people first. Show interest in your subordinates’ off-the-job\n",
      "accomplishments. Treat everyone with dignity. Remind yourself that the\n",
      "primary purpose in life is to enjoy it. As a general rule, the more interest\n",
      "you show in a person, the more he will produce for you. And his production\n",
      "is what carries you forward to greater and greater success.\n",
      "Praise your subordinates to your supervisor by putting in plugs for them\n",
      "at every opportunity. It’s an old American custom to admire the fellow\n",
      "who’s on the side of the little man. Your subordinates will appreciate your\n",
      "plugs, and their loyalty to you will grow. And do not fear that this will\n",
      "lower your own importance in the eyes of your supervisor. Rather, a man\n",
      "big enough to be humble appears more confident than the insecure man\n",
      "who feels compelled to call attention to his accomplishments. A little\n",
      "modesty goes a long way.\n",
      "Praise your subordinates personally at every opportunity. Praise them for\n",
      "their cooperation. Praise them for every extra effort they put forth. Praise is\n",
      "the greatest single incentive you can give people, and it costs you nothing.\n",
      "Besides, a write-in vote has often overthrown a powerful, known candidate.\n",
      "You never know when your subordinates can do you a turn by coming to\n",

      "Several months ago the president of a medium-sized company asked me\n",
      "to help him make an important decision. This executive had built the\n",
      "business by himself and had been functioning as sales manager. Now, with\n",
      "seven salesmen employed, he decided his next step was to promote one of\n",
      "his salesmen to the job of sales manager. He narrowed the choice down to\n",
      "three, all of whom were about equal in experience and sales performance.\n",
      "My assignment was to spend one day in the field with each man and then\n",
      "report my views on which fellow seemed to be best qualified to lead the\n",
      "group. Each man was told that a consultant would visit him to discuss the\n",

      "Two of the men reacted pretty much the same way. Both were\n",
      "uncomfortable with me. They seemed to sense that I was there to “change\n",
      "things.” Each of these men was a real defender of the status quo. Both\n",
      "approved of the way everything was being done. I raised questions about\n",
      "how the territories were laid out, the compensation program, the sales\n",
      "promotional material—every facet of the marketing effort. But on all points,\n",
      "the response was always “Everything is okay.” On specific points these two\n",
      "men explained why the present way couldn’t and shouldn’t be changed.\n",
      "Summed up, both men wanted the status quo to remain the status quo. One\n",
      "of them said to me as he dropped me by my hotel, “I don’t know exactly\n",
      "why you spent the day with me, but tell Mr. M. for me that everything is\n",
      "okay as is. Don’t go refiguring anything.”\n",
      "The third man was wonderfully different. He was pleased with the\n",

      "As a youngster, I had an opportunity to see how the different thinking of\n",
      "two leaders can make an amazing difference in the performance of\n",
      "followers.\n",
      "I attended a country elementary school: eight grades, one teacher, and\n",
      "forty children all jammed together inside four brick walls. A new teacher\n",
      "was always a big deal. Led by the big boys—the seventh- and eighth-\n",
      "graders—the pupils set out to see how much they could get away with.\n",
      "One year there was little more than chaos. Every day there were dozens\n",
      "of the usual school pranks, “wars” of spitballs, and paper airplanes. Then\n",
      "there were the major incidents such as locking the teacher outside the\n",
      "school for half a day at a time, or on another occasion the opposite,\n",
      "barricading her within the building for hours. Another day each boy in the\n",
      "upper grades brought his dog into the schoolroom.\n",
      "Let me add that these children were not delinquents. Stealing, physical\n",
      "violence, and deliberate harm were not their objectives. They were healthy\n",
      "kids conditioned by vigorous rural living and needing an outlet for their\n",
      "tremendous pent-up energies and ingenuities.\n",
      "Well, the teacher somehow managed to stay with the school until the end\n",
      "of that year. To no one’s surprise, there was a new teacher the following\n",
      "September.\n",
      "The new teacher extracted strikingly different performance from the\n",
      "children. She appealed to their personal pride and sense of respect. She\n",
      "encouraged them to develop judgment. Each child was assigned a specific\n",
      "responsibility like washing blackboards or cleaning erasers, or practicing\n",
      "paper grading for the younger grades. The new teacher found creative ways\n",
      "to use the energy that had been so misdirected a few months before. Her\n",
      "educational program was centered on building character.\n",
      "Why did the children act like young devils one year and like young\n",
      "angels the next? The difference was the leader, their teacher. In all honesty,\n",
      "we cannot blame the kids for playing pranks an entire school year. In each\n",
      "instance the teacher set the pace.\n",
      "The first teacher, deep down, didn’t care whether the children made\n",
      "progress. She set no goals for the children. She didn’t encourage them. She\n",
      "couldn’t control her temper. She didn’t like teaching, so the pupils didn’t\n",
      "like learning.\n",
      "But the second teacher had high, positive standards. She sincerely liked\n",
      "the children and wanted them to accomplish much. She considered each one\n",
      "as an individual. She obtained discipline easily because in everything she\n",
      "did, she was well disciplined.\n",
      "And in each case, the pupils adjusted their conduct to fit the examples set\n",
      "by the teachers.\n",
      "We find this same form of adjustment taking place every day in adult\n",
      "groups. During World War II military chiefs continually observed that the\n",

      "“relaxed,” and “lackadaisical.” Crack units were led by officers with high\n",

      "break with another company executive, but through clear thinking he found\n",
      "the source of the problem and the way to correct it. Others reported that\n",

      "To be a more effective leader, put these four leadership principles to work:\n",
      "1. Trade minds with the people you want to influence. It’s easy to get others\n",
      "to do what you want them to do if you’ll see things through their eyes.\n",
      "Ask yourself this question before you act: “What would I think of this if I\n",
      "exchanged places with the other person?”\n",
      "2. Apply the “Be-Human” rule in your dealings with others. Ask, “What is\n",
      "the human way to handle this?” In everything you do, show that you put\n",
      "other people first. Just give other people the kind of treatment you like to\n",
      "receive. You’ll be rewarded.\n",
      "3. Think progress, believe in progress, push for progress. Think\n",
      "improvement in everything you do. Think high standards in everything\n",
      "you do. Over a period of time subordinates tend to become carbon copies\n",
      "of their chief. Be sure the master copy is worth duplicating. Make this a\n",
      "personal resolution: ‘At home, at work, in community life, if it’s progress\n",
      "I’m for it.”\n",
      "4. Take time out to confer with yourself and tap your supreme thinking\n",
      "power. Managed solitude pays off. Use it to release your creative power.\n",
      "Use it to find solutions to personal and business problems. So spend\n",
      "some time alone every day just for thinking. Use the thinking technique\n",

systematic fashion (the learningrule)the process is repeated until the performance isacceptableon the otherhand, if there is plenty of data and the problem is poorlyunderstood to derive an approximate model, then neuralnetwork technology is a good choicethis operatingprocedure should be contrasted with the traditionalengineering design, made of exhaustive subsystemspecifications and intercommunication protocolsso, it is difficult tobring a priori information into the design, and when thesystem does no t work properly it is also hard toare extremely efficient in terms of development time andresources, and in many difficult problems artificial neuralnetworks provide performance that is difficul t to match withother technologiesdenker 10 years ago said that

demonstrates informationprocessing characteristics that give an approximate solutionto a given problemthe anns have been widely used incomplex non linear function mapp ing, image processing,pattern recogni tion & classification & so onfeed -forwardnetworks are common type of neural networksa feedforward network comprises an input layer, where the inputsof the problem are received, hidden layers, where therelations hip between the inputs & outputs are determined &represented by synaptic weights, & an output layer whichemits the outputs of the problemthe neural feed forwardnetwork is modeled with three basic elements:  a) a set ofsynapses characterized by synapti c weights,  b) an adder orlinear combiner for summing the input signalsc) anactivation function for limiting the amplitude of the outputof neuron to some finite valuethe input of the activationfunction can be increased by using a bias termhere, wehave made use of a certain ann architecture known as themulti -layer -feed-forward neural network or multi layerperceptron (mlp)2 style of neural computationand a corresponding desire d or target response set at theoutput (when this is the case the training is calledsupervised)an error is composed from the differencebetween the desired response and the system outputthiserror information is fed back to the system and adjusts thesystem parameters in a systematic fashion (the learningrule)the process is repeated until the performance isacceptableon the otherhand, if there is plenty of data and the problem is poorlyunderstood to derive an approximate model, then neuralnetwork technology is a good choicethis operatingprocedure should be contrasted with the traditionalengineering design, made of exhaustive subsystemspecifications and intercommunication protocolsso, it is difficult tobring a priori information into the design, and when thesystem does no t work properly it is also hard toare extremely efficient in terms of development time andresources, and in many difficult problems artificial neuralnetworks provide performance that is difficul t to match withother technologiesdenker 10 years ago said that \"artificialneural networks are the second best way to implement asolution\" motivated by the simplicity of their design andbecause of their universality, only shadowed by thetraditional d esign

subclass of acrylic networks in which aconnection is allowed from a node in layer i only to nodessuccinctly described by a sequence of numbers indicatingthe number of nodes in each layerfor instance, the network shown in fig4 is a 3 -2-3-2 feed forward network;nodes in the first hidden layer (layer 1), three nodes in thesecond hidden layer (layer 2), and two nodes in  the outputlayer (layer 3)these networks, generally with no morethan four such layers, are among the most common neuralnets in use, so much so that some users identify the phrase“neural networks” to mean only feed forward

equally obvious that animals,especially the higher order animals, learn as they growhow does this learning occur? what are possiblemathematical models of learning?  in this section, wesummarize some of the basic theories of biological learningand their adaptations for artificial neural networkslearning is the process by which therandom -valued parameters (weights and bias) of a neuralnetwork are

network (ann) isan information -processing paradigm that is inspired by the waybiological nervous systems such as brain, process informationann consists of multiple layers of simple processing elementscalled as neuronsthe neuron performs two functions, namel y,collection of inputs & generation of an outputuse of annprovides overview of the theory, learning rules, and applicationsof the most important neural network models, definitions andstyle of computationthe mathematical model of networkthrows the light on the concept of inputs, weights, summingfunction, activation function & outputsthen ann helps todecide the type of learning for  adjustment of weights withchange in parametersfinally the analysis of a system iscompleted by ann implementation  & ann training &

requiring very little effortthis necessitates the study andsimulation of neural networksthe neural network of anhuman is part of its nervous system, containing a largenumber of interconnected neurons (nerve cells)“neural” isan adjective for neuron, and “network” denotes a graph likestructureartificial neural network refers to computingsystems whose central them e is borrowed from the analogyof biological neural networksartificial neural networksare also referred to as “neural nets”, artificial neuralsystems “parallel distributed processing systems” and“connectionist systems”for a computing system to becalled by these pretty names, it is necessary for the systemto have a labeled directed graph structure where nodesperform some simple computationsfrom elementary graphtheory we recall that a “directed graph” consists of a set of“nodes”  (vertices) and  a set of “connections”(edges/links/arcs) connecting pairs of nodesthissystem is the alternative for human expertise and knowledgeartificial neural networks are modeled closelyfollowing the brain and therefore a great deal ofterminology is borrowed from neuroscienceliterature reviewakurban investigated an artificial

demonstrates informationprocessing characteristics that give an approximate solutionto a given problemthe anns have been widely used incomplex non linear function mapp ing, image processing,pattern recogni tion & classification & so onfeed -forwardnetworks are common type of neural networksa feedforward network comprises an input layer, where the inputsof the problem are received, hidden layers, where therelations hip between the inputs & outputs are determined &represented by synaptic weights, & an output layer whichemits the outputs of the problemthe neural feed forwardnetwork is modeled with three basic elements:  a) a set ofsynapses characterized by synapti c weights,  b) an adder orlinear combiner for summing the input signalsc) anactivation function for limiting the amplitude of the outputof neuron to some finite valuethe input of the activationfunction can be increased by using a bias termhere, wehave made use of a certain ann architecture known as themulti -layer -feed-forward neural network or multi layerperceptron (mlp)2 style of neural computationand a corresponding desire d or target response set at theoutput (when this is the case the training is calledsupervised)an error is composed from the differencebetween the desired response and the system outputthiserror information is fed back to the system and adjusts thesystem parameters in a systematic fashion (the learningrule)the process is repeated until the performance isacceptableon the otherhand, if there is plenty of data and the problem is poorlyunderstood to derive an approximate model, then neuralnetwork technology is a good choicethis operatingprocedure should be contrasted with the traditionalengineering design, made of exhaustive subsystemspecifications and intercommunication protocolsso, it is difficult tobring a priori information into the design, and when thesystem does no t work properly it is also hard toare extremely efficient in terms of development time andresources, and in many difficult problems artificial neuralnetworks provide performance that is difficul t to match withother technologiesdenker 10 years ago said that \"artificialneural networks are the second best way to implement asolution\" motivated by the simplicity of their design andbecause of their universality, only shadowed by thetraditional d esign obtained by studying the physics of theproblemat present, artificial neural networks are emergingas the technology of choice for many applications, such aspattern recognition, prediction, system

subclass of acrylic networks in which aconnection is allowed from a node in layer i only to nodessuccinctly described by a sequence of numbers indicatingthe number of nodes in each layerfor instance, the network shown in fig4 is a 3 -2-3-2 feed forward network;nodes in the first hidden layer (layer 1), three nodes in thesecond hidden layer (layer 2), and two nodes in  the outputlayer (layer 3)these networks, generally with no morethan four such layers, are among the most common neuralnets in use, so much so that some users identify the phrase“neural networks” to mean only feed forward networksconceptually, node s in successively higher layers abstractsuccessively higher level features from preceding layersfig4 feed forwa rd networkscneural learningbrain are “hard wired” it is equally obvious that animals,especially the higher order animals, learn as they growhow does this learning occur? what are possiblemathematical models of learning?  in this section, wesummarize some of the basic theories of biological learningand their adaptations for artificial neural networkslearning is the process by which therandom -valued parameters (weights and bias) of a neuralnetwork are adapted through a continuous process ofsimulation by the environment in which network isembeddedlearning rate is defined as the rate at whichnetwork gets adaptedtype of learning is determined by themanner in which parameter change takes placelearningmay be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervisedlearning and r einforced learningthis isavailable and learning must rely on guidance obtainedheuristically by the system examining different sample dataor the environmentlearning is similar to training ionehas to learn somethi ng which is analogous to one has to betraineda neural network has to be configured such that theapplication of a set of inputs produces (either \\'direct\\' or viaa relaxation process) the desired set of outputsanother way is to \\'train\\' the neural network byfeeding it teaching patterns and letting it change its weightsaccording to some learning rulewe  can categorize thelearning situations in two distinct sortsthese are1supervised learningsupervised learning  or associative learning in which thenetwork is trained by providing it with input and matchingoutput patternsthese input -output pairs can be provided byan external teacher, or by the system which contains theneural network (self -supervised)example:  anarchaeologist discovers a human skeleton and has todetermine whether it belonged to man or womanexamination of these pastexamples (called the training set) allows the archaeologistto learn about the distinctions between male and femaleskeletonsthis learning process is an example of supervisedlearning, and th e result of learning process can be applied todetermine whether the newly discovered skeleton belongs toman or woman5 supervised learning2unsupervised learningunsupervised learning  or self -organization in which an(output) unit is trained to  respond to clusters of patternwithin the inputunlike the supervised learning paradigm, there is no a prioriset of categories into which the pat terns are to be classified;rather the system must develop its own representation of thearchaeologist has to determine whether a set of skeletonfragments belong to the same dinosaur species or need to  bedifferentiated into different speciesfor this task, noprevious data may be available to clearly identify thespecies for each skeleton fragmentthe archaeologist has todetermine whether the skeletons (that can be reconstructedfrom the fragments) are sufficiently similar to belong to thesame species, or if the differences between these skeletonsare large enough to warrant grouping them into differentspeciesthis is an unsupervised learning process, whichthe skeletonsone archaeologist may believe the skeletonsbelong to different species, while another may disagree, andthere is no absolute criterion to determine who is correctreinforced learningreinforcement learning  is type of learning may beconsidered as an intermediate form of the above two typesof learninghere the learning machine does some action onthe environment and gets a feedback response from theenvironmentthe learning system grades its action good(rewarding ) or bad (punishable) based on the environmentalresponse and accordingly adjusts its parametersgenerally,parameter adjustment is continued until an equilibrium stateoccurs, following which there will be       no more changesbe categorized under this type of learningdback propagation networkthe back propagation algorithm (rumelhart andmcclelland, 1986) is used in  layered feed -forward annsthis means that the artificial neurons are  organized inlayers,  and send their signals “forward”, and then the errorsare propagated backwardsthe network receives inputs byneurons in the input layer , and the output of the network isgiven  by the neurons on an output layerthere may be oneor m ore intermediate hidden layersthe back propagationalgorithm uses supervised learning, which means that weprovide the  algorithm with examples of the inputs andoutputs we want the network to compute, and  then the error(difference between actual and exp ected results) iscalculatedthe idea of  the back propagation algorithm is toreduce this error, until the ann learns the training  datathe training begins with random weights, and the goal is toadjust them so that the  error will be minimalbackpropagation network has gained importance due to theshortcomings of other available networksthe network is amulti layer network (multi layer perception) that contains atleast one hidden layer in addition to input and output layersnumber of hidden laye rs & numbers of neurons in eachhidden layer is to be fixed based on application, thecomplexity of the problem and the number of inputs andoutputsuse of non -linear log -sigmoid transfer functionenables the network to simulate non -linearity in practicalsystemsdue to this numerous advantages, backpropagation network is chosen for present workphasesfirst phase is known as training while the secondphase is called testingtraining, in bac k propagation isbased on gradient decent rule that tends to adjust weightsand reduce system error in the networksimilarly,output layer neurons are same in the number as number ofoutputsnumber of hidden layer neurons is deciding by trialand error method using the experimental dataeann development & implementationdeveloped, using the neural network toolbox of mat labdifferent anns are build rather than using one large annbetter adjustment of the ann for each specific problem,outputann training & predicti on qualityone of the most relevant aspects of a neural network isduring neural network training is called over fittingtheerror on the training set is driven to a very small value, butwhen new data is presented to the network, the error islargethe network has memorized the training examples,but it has not learned to generalize to new situationsonemethod for improving net work generalization is to use anetwork that is just large enough to provide an adequate fitthe larger network you use the more complex functions thenetwork can createthere are two other methods forneural network toolbox software: regularization & earlystoppingthe typical performance function used fortraining feed forward neural networks is the mean sum o fsquares of the network errors,performance function by adding a term that consists of themean of the sum of the squares of the network weights &msereg = λmse +(1 -λ)msw,                                       (3)where λ  is the performance ratio, &using this performance function causes the network to havesmaller weights & biases, & this force t he network responseto be smoother & less likely to over fitonce the differentstages of the training process & the ann structure had beendetermined, & before the optimization procedure isdeveloped, it is important to estimate the ann predictionqualit iesthere is excellent agreement of predicted values& expected valuesthis close agreement shows that theann can be used in the data analysis, of theoretical work togenerate the missing data in the theoretical programtheresults of model ann are com pared with the hydrodynamicsimulation datathe artificial neural
